            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE TO THE READER</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>Chriſtian Reader,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>IT is an old and true ſaying, <hi>Veritas non quaeris Angulos,</hi> Truth is neither afraid nor aſhamed to be ſeen, though thereby ſhe be expoſed to the ſevereſt and moſt critical tryals and examinations of men, neither is ſhe at all deſirous to appear in ſuch a dreſs, as that thereby ſhe may inſinuate her ſelf into the affections of men for this end, that through their intereſt in, and byaſſing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence upon the underſtanding, it may be bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed to a partiality on her ſide; her evidence and power is ſuch, as makes that needleſs, <hi>Magua eſt &amp; prevalebit:</hi> In the enſuing Treatiſe thou haſt a Doctrine and practice maintained, which, I doubt not, will be owned by our Lord Jeſus Chriſt in the day of his appearing, to be part of that Faith once delivered to the Saints, for
<pb facs="tcp:106624:3"/>which it is his will they ſhould earneſtly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend; which Doctrine and practice, as I have endeavoured to preſent to thy view, in the ſole light of Divine evidence, rationally deduced from that great Luminary of the Scriptures, without immixing any thing of humane Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, for the bribing the underſtanding by ſubtle, inſinudations upon thy affections, (a courſe, which as my natural Genius leads me not unto, ſo my indigency, as to abillities, prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits my my attempting of) ſo the foreſtalling thy Judgment, by any ſubtle artifices of one kind or another, is none of my deſign in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Preface. There are only three things, I conceive neceſſary to be done, to prepare the Readers way to a more profitable peruſal of the Diſcourſe here tendered to him.</p>
            <p>Firſt, That <hi>I</hi> ſhould indeavour to remove, at leaſt allay, that prejudice that may poſſibly ariſe in the minds of ſome againſt it, as coming a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad at ſuch a time as this is, whereby they might be kept from that due peruſal and through examination and weighing of what is here tendred to them as is neceſſary, in order to their reaping that benefit deſigned to them by it; and thus, though there are ſeveral prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces may poſſibly ariſe in the minds of men, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their previous perſwaſions, relating to the practice here pleaded for, yet I ſhall only take notice of that, which may ariſe from the ſeeming unſeaſonableneſs, of ſending forth a Diſcourſe of this nature at ſuch a time as this
<pb facs="tcp:106624:3"/>is, and as affairs now ſtand with the parties, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween whom this controverſie hath of late years been more eſpecially agitated, poſſibly thou mayſt think the Author rather deſerves a Cenſure of, at leaſt, indiſcretion, than the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcourſe it ſelf a ſerious peruſal and examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>And it cannot be denied, but that an under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking of this nature, at ſuch a time, doth car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and that in ſeveral reſpects, a very great ſhew of unſeaſonableneſs in it, and had not the ſence and apprehenſion of the preſent ſtate of affairs detained me under an irreſolution as to its publication, this Diſcourſe might have ſeen the light much ſooner than now it doth; and yet had I not had the approbation of thoſe, whoſe Judgments I had reaſon to attend unto, it had not now, no nor ever, for ought I know, appeared in ſo publick a way as now it doth: But ſeeing it is thus come abroad, let me in brief give the Reader an account of the ground of my proceedings herein: Yet I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it unneceſſary, to trouble the Reader with an account of the ſeveral occaſions, through which my thoughts came at firſt ſo to be enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, and after to be carried on in a more tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row ſearch into this Controverſie; I ſhall only give him an account of the ground of my ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing abroad this Diſcourſe (wherein he will find the reſult of that ſearch I have made) at this time. And in general take it thus:</p>
            <p>Upon further and more ſerious adviſements with my ſelf, and conſultations with others,
<pb facs="tcp:106624:4"/>I could not conceive, how the ſending of it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, though at ſuch a time, ſhould be juſtly accounted ſo unſeaſonable, as upon the firſt view it may, and for a while to me it did ſeem to be. When the practice here pleaded for, by the unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous conſent of all parties, lyes from among the Fundamentals of Chriſtian Religion, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently, ſuppoſing the worſt, it ſhould at laſt be found to be unſcriptural; the contrary whereunto I am moſt confident of (whether groundleſs or no, let the intelligent and impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Reader judge) yet the conſcientious im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracement of it cannot be deſtructive to the Souls of men, when nothing is brought to light, beyond what was of publick and general cogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zance before, when the judgment and practice of the contrary minded is no way concerned in the ſufferings they are ſubject or liable to, and conſequently, the detection of their error can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be rationally ſuppoſed to further their ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, when no new Controverſie is ſtarted, and conſequently, no new rents or diviſions like to be made, beyond what have been of ſo long continuance; how the appearing in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick of ſuch a Diſcourſe upon this Subject ſhould at this time, or any other time, be accounted much unſeaſonable, I could give no rational account, either to my ſelf or to others: As for the manner of handling it, I am not conſcious to my ſelf of having given any juſt cauſe of offence unto any; what thou wilt meet with here, is argumentative, not invective, aiming at thy information and confirmation, in what I verily
<pb facs="tcp:106624:4"/>judge to be the Truth, not thy prejudice either in temporals or ſpirituals: In a word, unleſs the naked propoſal of my own perſwaſion, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating to the Controverſie here debated, with the Scripture evidence, captivating my under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding into that perſwaſion, can be grievous or offenſive unto any, I cannot conceive how the enſuing Diſcourſe can be.</p>
            <p>But it may be it may be ſaid, There is yet a double inconvenience, or a twofold ill conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence may ariſe from the publication of a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcourſe of this nature at ſuch a time.</p>
            <p>Firſt, The minds of Chriſtians will be in danger to be diverted from what is more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly their work, and about which they ought more eſpecially to be taken up.</p>
            <p>To that I anſwer, I wiſh the enſuing Papers may find the minds of Chriſtians ſo well im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed, as that ſuch a divertion would be indeed prejudicial to them; but be it ſo, as in reſpect of ſome, I hope, it may be, yet the exerciſe of a little prudence will prevent that inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; and let me here caution the Reader to take heed, that he do not by this, or any other Controverſie, divert his mind from the more weighty concernments of his Soul; take heed thou do not ſo apply thy mind to, nor ſuffer thy thoughts to be taken up with any matters of controverſie, as to neglect thy growth in Grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, but, I ſay, a little Chriſtian pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence will direct in this, and obviate the incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience ſuggeſted.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:106624:5"/>
            <p>But ſecondly, It will be ſaid, The appearing thus in publick may occaſion the revival of theſe Controverſies, which ſeem now almoſt laid aſide and forgotten among the People of God, and conſequently may renew, heighten and increaſe thoſe diviſions, which heretofore have been of ſuch ſad conſequence, as to their unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous and concordant practice of the main things of Religion.</p>
            <p>To this I ſhall anſwer, I am not altogether without hope of the quite contrary, <hi>viz.</hi> That it may be of ſome uſe for the obtaining and promoting union among them,</p>
            <p>There is a double union that the People of God are to labour after.</p>
            <p>Firſt, An union of judgment and practice, that they may think, ſpeak, and do the ſame things.</p>
            <p>Secondly, An union in heart and affection, that wherein they do differ in judgment and practice, they may bear with, and forbear one another in love.</p>
            <p>Now what means can have a more direct tendency, or be more effectual (will the Lord pleaſe to concur with his bleſſing) for the ob<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>taining and promoting either of theſe kinds of union, than the holding forth with a Spirit of meekneſs what light is received from the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, about the things, wherein the difference and diſagreement is?</p>
            <p>As for the former, 'tis utterly impoſſible ever to be attained among thoſe, who dare not, as we uſe to ſay, pin their faith upon other mens
<pb facs="tcp:106624:5"/>ſleeves, or practice hand over head, whatever is propoſed to them, by any means excluſive of this; and with what confidence ſoever any attempts may be made to effect this union any other way, they will be found utterly unavail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and probably iſſue in the quite contrary event to what is aimed at.</p>
            <p>But ſuppoſe this firſt and moſt excellent kind of union, which we ought ultimately to aim at and endeavour, ſhould not be attained, the ſame differences in judgment and practice ſhould yet remain, yet methinks I may, yea, I cannot but rationally expect, that the latter, <hi>viz.</hi> of heart and affection, will be ſo far from being impeded and obſtructed, that it will be conſiderably ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced and promoted, though diſſenters may not come over to my judgment and practiſe by what is here offered, yet ſure I may promiſe my ſelf, without concurring the cenſure of being over confident of the Truth aſſerted, or the ſtrength and validity of the Arguments produced for its confirmation, that it will be granted that in caſe I do err, it is <hi>cunt ratione,</hi> and that I have ſo much ground from Scripture to bottom my judgment and practice upon, as may acquit me, in the judgment of Charity, without ſtretching it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the bounds allowed in Scripture and war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranted by Reaſon, from a wilful perſiſting in er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror; and I hardly know any thing more effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual for the maintaining love and friendſhip among diſſenting Chriſtians, then for them to be mutually ſatisfied in each other, that they do not diſſent upon any other account then their
<pb facs="tcp:106624:6"/>reſpective conſcientiouſneſs of their duty to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God, which ſatisfaction can hardly be given in a more effectual manner, than by hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth and declaring each to other the light they have received from the Scriptures of truth, captivating their judgments to the imbrace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and practice of what they do differently imbrace and practice; ſo that I cannot but hope the ſending abroad the enſuing Diſcourſe, will be ſo far from reviving a Controverſie, almoſt laid aſleep and forgotten, to the diſuniting of Chriſtians, and heightening their differences and diviſions, that it may be of ſome good uſe for the promoting the quite contrary end, <hi>viz,</hi> their uniting, if not in judgment, that they may be as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.10. <gap reason="foreign">

<pb facs="tcp:106624:6"/>partly from what the God of Wiſdom, or the only wiſe God declares to be his expectation, from thoſe either over whom it is lift up in the threatning, or upon whom it is laid in the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, and partly from what the men of wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, as the Prophet there ſpeaks, have done in anſwer to this voice, what are Gods expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons he tells us, <hi>Jer.</hi> 8.6. <hi>I ſaith the Lord hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kened and heard, but no man ſpake aright;</hi> and wherein they failed in ſpeaking aright he tells us, <hi>no man ſaid, what have I done,</hi> or which is of the ſame importance, what have I not done, what have I omitted and neglected that I ought to have done; the Rod calls to us to call our ſelves to an impartial account, wherein we have either come ſhort of, or exceeded that Rule we ought to walk by, what men of wiſdom have done in anſwer to this voice of the Rod, ſee in that <hi>Lam.</hi> 3.40. <hi>Let us ſearch our wayes and turn unto the Lord;</hi> when God is ſearching after our ſins, eſpecially when the ſearch is made by afflictions, when God hath us upon the rack, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

But ſuppoſe, notwithſtanding what hath been ſaid, the ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing abroad of theſe Papers at this time, ſhould by any be judged unſeaſonable, I have three things yet further to offer for my vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</p>
            <p>Firſt, I conſidered, that for the Mind to hang in ſuſpence, and lye under the preſſure of fluctuating uncertainties about the mind and will of Chriſt, relating to the diſcharge of duty, is, at any time greivous, but more eſpecially when the hand of God is lift up, and that I know is the caſe of ſome truly conſcientious Chriſtians, in reference to the practice here pleaded for, and I judged it my duty to yield unto them what relief my mean ability would reach unto.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:106624:7"/>
            <p>Secondly, I conſidered that ſaying of the Wiſe man, <hi>He that obſerveth the Wind ſhall not ſow, and he that regardeth the Clouds ſhall not reap,</hi> Eccleſ. 11.4. And whether I might live to ſee a more ſeaſonable time was altogether uncertain unto me; and for me to obſerve the Wind, and ſtand gazing on the Clouds, till over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken by the night of death, where no man can work, and laid to ſleep in the duſt, and thereby have loſt my ſeaſon for the ſowing the Seed, that Seed, of which I may and muſt ſay it is, <hi>Meſhee</hi> as that word, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 126.6. is ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred by <hi>Junius</hi> and ſome others, it is, <hi>Semon acquiſitum, Semen aliunde comparatum,</hi> Seed that I have through Grace obtained from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſtore, I hope I may truly ſay from his, who, as the Apoſtle ſaith. <hi>Miniſters ſeed to the ſower, and bread to the eater;</hi> and that to uſe the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor aforementioned his words, <hi>Prece &amp; pretio,</hi> yet not ſo much of Silver and Gold, as of that, which by the Teſtimony of the Holy Ghoſt himſelf is the iſſue of much ſtudy, <hi>viz.</hi> weari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and I may add, wearing away of the fleſh; I was ſaying, ſhould I have obſerved the Winds, and ſtood gazing on the Clouds, till loſt my ſeaſon to ſow this ſame Seed contained in the enſuing Treatiſe: I could not have expected to reap when the Harveſt comes, what now through Grace I can in ſome meaſure live in the comfortable expectations of, ſeaſons loſt, though ſometing unſeaſonable prove a loſs to the Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandman when the harveſt comes.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:106624:8"/>
            <p>Thirdly, The ſending forth theſe Papers was neceſſary to prepare a way to, and lay a founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for a few practical ſheets, which, if the Lord vouchſafe life and opportunity, may fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, wherein I intend, as the Lord ſhall aſſiſt, to make a more full enquiry into theſe four things.</p>
            <p>Firſt, What are the Reaſons of Gods ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointing the application of the Token of the Covenant to the Infant ſeed of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</p>
            <p>Secondly, What are the benefits and advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages ariſing to them thereby,</p>
            <p>Thirdly, What is the duty of Parents to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards their Children, as incorporated by Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm into the Myſtical Body of Chriſt, as vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible.</p>
            <p>And fourthly, What is the improvement that Children themſelves may and ought to make of their Baptiſm, applyed unto them in their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy, as they grow up to years of maturity which things I could not fitly ſpeak unto be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their Covenant-intereſt and right to the Sign and Token of the Covenant ariſing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>from was proved; ſo that the appearing thus in publick, in the defence of the practice of Infant-baptiſm, was in ſome ſort neceſſary unto me.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Another thing I conceive neceſſary for the preparing the Readers way to a more profitable peruſal of the inſuing Treatiſe, is, to make ſome enquiries, what may have had, and ſtill hath too great an intereſt in the ſo far pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing
<pb facs="tcp:106624:8"/>of the judgment and practice of lying oppoſite to that here pleaded for; 'tis, I confeſs, ſomething ſtrange to me, whence it ſhould come to paſs, that ſo many, and thoſe, at leaſt many of them, truly conſcientious Chriſtians, ſhould at ſo eaſie a rate part with, and give up their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drens priviledge, as to intereſt in the Covenant, and the Token thereof, and ſo readily take up an opinion and practice diveſting them there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</p>
            <p>Three things have often occurred to my thoughts, as rendring this matter of wonder unto me.</p>
            <p>Firſt, The plain evidence, as to my under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, given in by the Scriptures to that their priviledge.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The utter ſilence of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, as to any expreſs, yea, or plainly deduced conſequential denial of it to them.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, That tenderneſs of affection natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral (and ſure Grace deſtroyes not Nature) to Parents towards their Children.</p>
            <p>Hence notwithſtanding what is urged on their parts from the Scripture, yet I cannot but conceive there is either ſomething wholly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centrical to the Queſtion it ſelf, or ſome irregu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity in the management of their enquiries, in reference thereunto, that hath had, and ſtill hath a conſiderable intereſt, at leaſt, in manyes rejecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Truth pleaded for, and their imbra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing the opinion and practice oppoſite there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:106624:9"/>
            <p>Now it may not be altogether unprofitable to make ſome inquiry what that ſhould be, that ſo the Reader being forewarned may diſintangle himſelf, and have his mind more free to attend to, and impartially weigh what is here tendered to him, and upon a ſerious enquiry, I conceive, theſe ſix things may be aſſigned, as of the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance mentioned,</p>
            <p>Firſt, I cannot but think it muſt in part be imputed to a want of that tenderneſs of affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on on towards Relations, attended with the want of a right apprehenſion and true ſenſe of the worth and excellency of ſpiritual Bleſſings, and Covenant-priviledges that Chriſtians ought to labour after, the Apoſtle mentions it as one of the evils of the laſt times. That men ſhall be without natural affection.</p>
            <p>Now though this evil prevail not in the hearts of truly gratious Souls to a predominan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, as it may and doth in the hearts of ſuch, who have only a form of Godlineſs; yet it is too uſually found, that truly gracious Souls are more or leſs corrupted by the Epidemical evils of the times and places where they live, in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectious times their blood and humors may be vitiated and corrupted, to the producing of ſome evil ſymptomes, upon whom yet the infection prevails not, to the breaking out into a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, to the taking away of their lives. Thus I cannot but think that this evil, of the want of natural affections, too far prevails in, though it prevails not over truly gracious Souls, to the giving a very great advantage to the ſo far
<pb facs="tcp:106624:9"/>ſpreading of the opinion and practice afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned; yet I do not ſay, neither would I be underſtood, as though I did ſuppoſe that this ſame evil hath been, or is the cauſe or occaſion of all their rejection of the practice pleaded for, and complying with the oppoſite opinion and practice, who yet do reject the one and imbrace the other: I do not doubt, but there are many among the contrary minded, who are perſons of much tenderneſs of affection towards their Children, and have in a good meaſure a right apprehenſion and due ſence of the worth and excellency of ſpiritual Bleſſings and Covenant-priviledges; nor yet would I be underſtood, as though I did ſuppoſe that this evil were only to be found among the perſons we now ſpeak of, no, I fear the ſame evil prevails too far in many of thoſe, who yet imbrace, yea, ſtand up in the defence of the practice of Infant-baptiſm, and though it doth not appear the ſame way, yet other wayes it doth; Inſtances evidencing this are too obvious than here to need a recital, the Diſeaſe is Epidemical, though appearing in ſome one way, and in others another way; but this I ſay, I do verily judge, that the ſo univerſal prevailing of this ſame evil, in this latter Age of the world will be found to have been one thing giving riſe to, and furthering the ſucceſs of the opinion &amp; practice here oppoſed; let but Parents get a due tenderneſs of affection towards their Children, and a right apprehenſion and due ſenſe of the worth and excellency of ſpiritual privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, and their minds will be much diſpoſed
<pb facs="tcp:106624:10"/>to an impartial weighing what if offered on the behalf of this practice of Infant-baptiſm.</p>
            <p>I am aware it will be retorted by my Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers, That it is a fond, fooliſh and irregular affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction towards Children, that hath bribed our underſtanding, and byaſſed us to a perſwaſion, that the Scripture holds forth ſome benefit or priviledge to them beyond what indeed it doth, our miſtakes ariſe from the byaſſing influences that theſe affections have upon our underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and judgments.</p>
            <p>But to this I ſhall only ſay, That it is not altogether unworthy our Obſervation, that Providence ſhould call forth ſuch to appear in defence of this practice,<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Baxter.</hi> Mr. <hi>Cooke,</hi> when they wrote, and my ſelf at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent being Batche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors.</note> who cannot be ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally ſuppoſed to have lain under the byaſs of any ſuch irregular affections; and as for others, who, it is true, might more rationally be ſuppoſed to lye under the force of ſuch a byasſ, yet their Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings ſufficiently declare, they had judgment as well as affection, and their lives and converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons evidence they had conſcience as well as judgment; their Writings ſhew they had ability to diſcern truth from error, and their lives ſhew their affections could not byaſs them to pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, but according as their judgments by Scripture evidence were convinced: There is then no rational ground for any to ſuppoſe, that our imbracement of, and appearing for the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice under conſideration, hath been, or is from
<pb facs="tcp:106624:10"/>any ſuch irregular workings of affection as is ſuggeſted; the danger lyes on the other hand: If then we would underſtand the mind of Chriſt, in reference to this practice here con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended for, labour to get a due tenderneſs of affection towards Children, with a right appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion and due ſenſe of the worth and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of ſpiritual priviledges: a due and a regular working of the affections towards any good rendered in the Covenant of Grace, hath a ſpecial ſubſerviency to our receiving of light from God through the Scriptures, in and about his will concerning our duty relating to our enjoyment of that good.</p>
            <p>Secondly, That which hath contributed not a little to the giving riſe to, and furthering the prevailing of the opinion and practice here oppoſed, hath been and is the confounding ſome either ſuppoſed or real irregularities in or attending the adminiſtration of Baptiſm to In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants, with the practice it ſelf, to mention theſe two things.</p>
            <p>Firſt, The manner of its adminiſtration.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The Subjects it hath been and frequently is adminiſtred unto.</p>
            <p>For the firſt, How oft is it found, that perſons of weaker judgments are prevailed with to reject the practice of Infant-baptiſm it ſelf, by a ſpecious Argument that yet only lyes againſt the way and manner of its adminiſtration among thoſe, who hold and maintain that practice; hence it may be obſerved, how that way and manner is pitched upon and pleaded
<pb facs="tcp:106624:11"/>againſt, that to the outward appearance ſeems, and is ſuppoſed by the perſons making uſe of this plea, to have the leaſt countenance from Scripture; and thus the way and manner pitched upon is, that of ſprinkling, which way and manner of adminiſtration, though diſuſed by many, if not generally by all, that with the greateſt ſtrength of Scripture Arguments have aſſerted the practice it ſelf; yet is urged by the contrary minded, as though the only way and manner of its adminiſtration among the <hi>Pedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſts;</hi> hence are thoſe frequent invectives againſt Infant-ſprinkling ſcattered up and down in the Writings, and too common in the mouths of our Oppoſers; and for the later, how apt are people, being told and perſwaded, that themſelves or others, as the Seed of unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving Parents, had no right to Baptiſm, to be induced to believe, that no Infants, let the Parents be what they will, have any better right than themſelves or others, born of ſuch Parents, had; and hence perceiving the undueneſs of their own Baptiſm in their infancy, are eaſily brought to believe the undueneſs of the Baptiſm of Infants in the general: And it is true, there are ſome other things (the irregularity of which as I ſhall not deny, ſo their refutation comes not within the compaſs of my preſent buſineſs) appertaining to the adminiſtration of Baptiſm to Infants, as by ſome it is adminiſtred, that give a like advantage to the ſucceſs of the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion and practice here oppoſed.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:106624:11"/>
            <p>But now whether the Infant-ſeed of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving Parents ought to be baptized, is one Queſtion.</p>
            <p>How or after what manner they ought to be baptized is another.</p>
            <p>What Parents may be reputed to be Believers, ſo as that their Infant-ſeed may upon their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count be baptized, is a third.</p>
            <p>Now it is the firſt of theſe Queſtions only, that is diſcuſſed in the inſuing Treatiſe, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is it at all neceſſary, that either of the two latter ſhould be taken notice of, or touched upon, in order to the finding out the mind and will of Chriſt relating unto this: Errors and irregularities, ſuppoſing them to be really ſo, in or attending the adminiſtration of Baptiſm, ought to be reformed, and not pleaded againſt the practiſe it ſelf: All therefore that I ſhall ſay to this is, let none confound what ought to be diſtinctly conſidered, labour firſt to find out the mind of Chriſt, as to the practiſe it ſelf, as abſtractly conſidered, without conſideration had to thoſe various Queſtions, the determination of which is of no uſe at all for the right deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of this; and having found out the mind of Chriſt relating to this firſt Queſtion, then the conſideration of the other will be more proper and ſeaſonable; the right metho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dizing of things highly conduceth to a right underſtanding the mind of Chriſt, reſpective to our duty, when the confounding or jumbling things together, that are of a diſtinct conſidra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſubjects to great miſtakes.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:106624:12"/>
            <p>Thirdly, That which hath had, and hath a a conſiderable intereſt in the giving riſe to, and furthering the ſucceſs of the opinion and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe here oppoſed, is the taking up particular Inſtances and Examples of perſons baptized, in the primitive times, upon their perſonal profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Faith and Repentance, without regard had to the caſe and condition of the perſons ſo baptized, antecedent to their Baptiſm, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently without conſidering the true reaſon and ground of their Baptiſme at that age, and upon ſuch a profeſſion and taking them as a full explication of that Commiſſion of Chriſt, warranting the application of Baptiſm, under the new Teſtament adminiſtration, as well ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative, ſhewing who ought not to be baptized, as poſitive, ſhewing who ought not to be baptized, as poſitive, ſhewing who ought to be baptized. And hence two things are inferred and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded.</p>
            <p>Firſt, That a ſolemn profeſſion of Faith and Repentance ought to precede the application of Baptiſm.</p>
            <p>Secondly, That none ought to be bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed but upon the precedency of ſuch a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion.</p>
            <p>But now let the caſes and conditions of the perſons, whoſe examples are produced, be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, and let the true reaſon and ground of their Baptiſm at ſuch an age, and upon ſuch a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, be inquired into: and thus we ſhall find, that the perſons we are now ſpeaking of, were either ſuch as were Memebers of the Jewiſh Church, as the natural Jews, and Gentile Profe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites,
<pb facs="tcp:106624:12"/>or elſe they were ſuch, who were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted from among the Gentiles. As for the caſe of the Gentiles, the reaſon and ground of their Baptiſm at ſuch an age, and upon ſuch a profeſſion, is obvious to all, and when any are ſtill converted from among the Heathens, and brought over to the imbracement of Chriſtianity, 'tis readily granted they are to be baptized according to the Inſtances produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced; but from thence it cannot with any ſhew of reaſon be concluded, that ſuch a profeſſion muſt univerſally antecede the application of Baptiſm; and as for the caſe of the Jews and Proſelytes, who before were Members of the Church, and anſwerably had <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> need of any new admiſſion into it, the Church ſtill remaining one and the ſame, the caſe and condition of none, ſince the deſolution of the Jewiſh Eccleſiaſtical Polity can poſſibly be imagined to anſwer thereunto or correſpond therewith, and therefore the Inſtances produced, either of Jews or Gentile Proſelytes being baptized at age, upon their perſonal profeſſion of faith and Repentance, ought not to be made the pattern of Baptiſm, as adminiſtred to or among the Gentiles, neither can any ſuch alteration in the Subjects, receptive of the Sign and Token of the Covenant, be concluded from theſe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances as is pretended; the reaſon of their Baptiſm, upon their perſonal profeſſion was, not becauſe under the new Teſtament adminiſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſuch a profeſſion is conſtantly and univerſally to antecede the application of Baptiſm, But the Reaſon was evidently twofold.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:106624:13"/>
            <p>Firſt, Becauſe now a new Sign and Token of the Covenant was inſtituted and appointed by Chriſt, which <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Seed, in their Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, were under an Obligation, by vertue of that firſt Command, to keep; and hence, as during the continuance of the firſt Token, <hi>viz.</hi> Circumciſion, they were, as, to be incorporated into the Church, or viſible Body of Chriſt, under an Obligation to receive and bear that, ſo upon the inſtitution of a new Token, <hi>viz.</hi> Baptiſm, they were ſtill, ſuppoſing the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of their Memberſhip in the Church, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to receive and bear that; and hence, though they were duly admitted into the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical Body of Chriſt, by Circumciſion applyed to them in their infancy, and had no need of another admiſſion, yet when another Sign or Token was appointed, though by the ceſſation of Circumciſion, their Memberſhip in the Church was not nulled or broken off, yet it was neceſſary they ſhould receive and bear that other Sign or Token now inſtituted by Chriſt, and that, that they might continue their obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to that firſt Command, to keep the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Becauſe the continuance of their Memberſhip did indiſpenſably require as a reformation in their judgments and practiſes, which was to be begun in Repentance, ſo they were to believe a new Article of Faith, <hi>viz. That that individual Perſon, the Man Chriſt Jeſus, was the Son of God, the promiſed Meſſiah and Saviour of the World;</hi> which Repentance
<pb facs="tcp:106624:13"/>and Faith were viſibly to be profeſſed, in order to their viſible continuance in the Church or myſtical Body of Chriſt; hence it was, that antecedent to their Baptiſm, the new Token of the Covenant, they were to make that profeſſion of their Faith and Repentance, from whence it appears, that their Baptiſm upon their perſonal profeſſion of Faith and Repentance, neither concludes themſelves antecedently not to be Members of the ſame Church, or myſtical Body of Chriſt, that baptiſm admits into, nor yet that a viſible profeſſion is indiſpenſably ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, antecedent to the application of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The other thing inferred from the forementioned Inſtances and Examples, and which follows upon this, is, That none ought to be baptized, but ſuch as are capable of making ſuch a Profeſſion: but now it will not follow, that becauſe ſome Inſtances are left upon record, of perſons being baptized at age upon their perſonal Faith and Repentance, that therefore none may be baptized but upon ſuch a profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; theſe Inſtances ſhew us what we may and ought to do, when a ſutable caſe occurs, but declare not what we ought to do, when caſes are no way parallel, hence though we have no expreſs mention made of the Baptiſm of Infants, <hi>in totidem verbis,</hi> yet having ſufficient diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of the mind of Chriſt as to that matter, the want of ſuch expreſs mention ought to be no let in our way, as to the application of Baptiſm unto them; therefore if we would come to the
<pb facs="tcp:106624:14"/>knowledge of the will of Chriſt, relating to the practice under debate, take heed we do not ſtumble at this ſtone, do not take up with the bare Inſtances and Examples of perſons bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed in primitive times, as though the full ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication, both negative and poſitive, of the Commiſſion of Chriſt, for the adminiſtration of Baptiſm, were to be deduced from them, but take in and improve the whole of what Chriſt hath left us in his Word, whether in the Old or in the New Teſtament, for the finding out of his mind and will relating unto this practice; And thus, I hope, Reader, thou wilt find in the inſuing Treatiſe, that he hath given us ſufficient diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries of his mind and will.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, That which hath given no little advantage to the opinion and practiſe here oppoſed is, the comparing the ſuppoſed littleneſs of good, and ſmalneſs of advantage accrewing to the Seed of Believers, by the utmoſt of what we contend for on their behalf, ſuppoſing that were granted to them, with the ſuppoſed greatneſs and variety of inconveniencies, and ill conſequences ariſing from the granting of it unto them.</p>
            <p>Hence we may obſerve, how our Oppoſers, with all their might, endeavour to diminiſh the good, pleaded by us to redound to the Seed of Believers, by their intereſt in the Covenant and Baptiſm, ſuppoſing the one ſhould be granted as their priviledge, and the other applyed unto them; and on the other hand, aggravate and ſet forth the variety of evils, inconveniencies
<pb facs="tcp:106624:14"/>and diſadvantages, ſuppoſed by them to follow upon the granting unto them ſuch a Covenant-intereſt and application of Baptiſm upon the ground thereof.</p>
            <p>But now all that I ſhall ſay to this is, as for the good benefit and advantage ariſing to the Infant-ſeed of believing Parents, from both their Covenant-ſtate and Baptiſm, as applyed unto them thereupon, 'tis exceeding great, as will, I hope, through Divine aſſiſtance, be made to appear, if Providence diſappoint not my preſent purpoſe: At preſent let this be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, as for their Covenant-intereſt and ſtate, a double benefit ariſeth to them there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by.</p>
            <p>Firſt, They are, as diſtributively taken, under a Promiſe of God being their God, in the ſence declared in the inſuing Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcourſe.</p>
            <p>Secondly, They are, as collectively taken, as Members of the viſible Church, under an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>definite Promiſe, ſuppoſing them grown to years of maturity, of being to taught of God, as ſavingly to know him.</p>
            <p>How far the certainty of their future Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, ſuppoſing them to dye in their infancy, may be concluded from their intereſt in theſe Promiſes, I ſhall leave to the judgment of the judicious Reader: This, I doubt not, will be found true at the appearing of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, when theſe Secrets ſhall be made mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt, that vaſtly the Major part of the Seed of Believers, and that by vertue of theſe very
<pb facs="tcp:106624:15"/>Promiſes made unto them, will be found the heirs of that Inheritance prepared for the Saints in light; miſtake me not, I do not ſay, the major part of the Seed of each particular Believer, but the major part of the Seed of Believers generally taken, or as taken one with another: But however methinks it ſhould not be account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a ſmall matter, to be brought in any ſenſe, though it be never ſo little nigher the Promiſes of Salvation, and into a nigher capacity and probability of injoying the good promiſed than the reſt of mankind are in, and that they muſt ſure be acknowledged to be, by that their Covenant-ſtate and intereſt in the Promiſes: And as for Baptiſm, the good and benefit of that is hinted in the cloſe of the inſuing Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcourſe, and is more fully to be declared, if the Lord will: As for the evils and miſchiefs, ſuppoſed to follow upon our Doctrine and practice, they are really none at all; whatever evils may be obſerved at any time to follow, they are only accidental, and will be found to have ſome other Original, and not be the natural and neceſſary fruits and conſequences of either the Doctrine or practice of Infant-Baptiſm.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, That which is of a like importance with what hath been hitherto mentioned is, peoples placing, at leaſt, too much of their Religion in an external way, mode or form, attended with an eaſineſs and facility to be drawn into this or that way by unſound and groundleſs motives and inducements; too many think, that if they are but of ſuch a way they
<pb facs="tcp:106624:15"/>are good Chriſtians, and ſecured as to their eternal ſtates; hence through the ſubtlety of Satan, and deceit of their own hearts, they over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>look and neglect the main things wherein the power of Religion doth indeed conſiſt, and betake themſelves to, and fall in with this or that way, as ſuppoſing themſelves thereby inſured for Salvation, and wanting judgment to diſcern between Truth and Error, fall in with the Judgment and practice under conſideration, as led thereunto meerly by ſome unſound and groundleſs motive and inducement; and though it is true, truly conſcientious Chriſtians cannot ſatisfie themſelves in a bare way or form, neither will they be led by any motives or inducements, without any regard at all had to the Word of God; yet even in reſpect of many of them, eſpecially ſuch who are of weaker Judgments, ſome unſound and groundleſs motive and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducement hath no little intereſt in their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing this or that way rather than any other; and thus the motives and iuducements leading Profeſſors into a complyance with the way, or judgment and practice, lying oppoſite to what we have here pleaded for, are exceeding vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, all which to enumerate would under me over tedious; all that I ſhall ſay therefore is, If we would come to a right underſtanding of the mind and will of our Lord Chriſt, place Religion where it ought to be placed, and then ſetting all ſuch motives and inducements aſide, weigh impartially the Scriptures, and Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments grounded thereupon, readily giving up
<pb facs="tcp:106624:16"/>our Judgments and practices to the guidance of the light and evidence of thoſe Scriptures and Arguments.</p>
            <p>Sixthly and laſtly, The perſwaſion and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice here oppoſed, have prevailed ſo far among Chriſtians, in a great meaſure, through their prepoſterous enquiries after the will of Chriſt, relating to the practice here pleaded for, taken in conjunction with the products of thoſe inquiries in and upon their own minds; and the prepoſterouſneſs of their inquiries lyes more eſpecially in theſe two things.</p>
            <p>Firſt, In their inquiring after the will of Chriſt as to the Baptiſm of Infants, before they have ſought after, or found out the proper uſes and ends of Baptiſm in the general, and the true notion under which it was inſtituted and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Secondly, In their inquiring after the will of Chriſt relating to this practice, without any precedent conſideration had to his will, relating to the intereſt of the Infants of believing Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents in the Covenant and Promiſes thereof: by theſe prepoſterous inquiries men put themſelves under a threefold diſadvantage, as to their find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out that will of Chriſt they are inquiring after.</p>
            <p>Firſt, They terminate and limit their inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries to the Scriptures of the new Teſtament, as ſuppoſing the whole will of Chriſt, relating un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Baptiſm, it being a new Teſtament Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, muſt needs be contained in them.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:106624:16"/>
            <p>Secondly, Which follows hereupon, They ſearch not after, nor attend unto the Tenour of the Covenant, as at firſt eſtabliſhed with <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> the Father of the Faithful, nor attend to the various Scriptures contained in the old Teſtament, opening and confirming that Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the Covenant, as ſo eſtabliſhed with him.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Which follows from both, They looſe the benefit of thoſe ſeveral Inferences that may rationally, and according to Scripture warrant, be drawn from intereſt in the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, for the determining and concluding what is the mind and will of Chriſt concerning the application of Baptiſm.</p>
            <p>But now would people begin their inquiries where they ought to do, and proceed regularly therein, they would find the mind and will of Chriſt to appear with much more clearneſs of evidence on the ſide of the practice we plead for; would they make their firſt inquiries after the proper uſes and ends of Baptiſm, and the true notion under which it is inſtituted, and then proceed in an impartial ſearch after the Tenour of the Covenant, and here again begin where they ought to do, <hi>viz.</hi> at the firſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſhment of it with <hi>Abraham</hi> the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the Faithful, and ſo proceed regularly, as the Covenant hath been continued, from one Generation to another, to <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Seed, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Natural or Myſtical, ſtill regulating their judgments about the additions, alterations and variations of the Covenant, together with the
<pb facs="tcp:106624:17"/>Sign and Token thereof, by what the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures declare of Gods proceeding therein from time to time, they would come to a more clear underſtanding what the will of Chriſt, relating to the practice under conſideration is.</p>
            <p>But when people ſhall look upon Baptiſm as abſtracted from its uſes and ends, and the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion under which it is commanded, and then limit and terminate their inquiries after the Subjects it is to be applyed unto, to the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of the new Teſtament, overlooking the whole of what God hath declared of his mind and will, touching a right to, and intereſt in the Covenant, throughout the old Teſtament, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving no regard to the ground, that intereſt in, and right to the Covenant gives to the Sign and Token of it, 'tis no wonder though they fall under ſo great miſtakes, eſpecially if we conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, in the ſecond place, the uſual iſſue and products of theſe inquiries, as thus prepoſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly managed in and upon the minds of men; and that is a ſtrong conceit, that becauſe they find not in ſo many expreſs words mention made of the Baptiſm of Infants in the new Teſtament, therefore undoubtedly it is not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the mind and will of Chriſt, that they ſhould be baptized; and people having their minds ſtrongly poſſeſſed with this conceit, are eaſily perſwaded, that they have no intereſt in, or right to the Covenant or Promiſes there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; whereas would they but, before their minds are poſſeſſed with ſuch a prejudicate conceit, ſearch after the intereſt of the Seed of Belivers
<pb facs="tcp:106624:17"/>in the Covenant throughout the whole Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, I doubt not, but as they would plainly diſcern that their intereſt, ſo they would more eaſily be perſwaded of their right to Baptiſm, the preſent Token of the Covenant; therefore if ever we would come to a clear underſtanding of the mind and will of Chriſt, relating to the Baptiſm of Infants, let our inquiries after it be regular.</p>
            <p>Theſe things <hi>I</hi> could willingly have ſpoken more fully to, but the Book ſwelling to a bigger bulk than I had hoped it would have done, and having ſtaid ſomething long in the Preſs, theſe brief hints ſhall ſuffice. And therefore,</p>
            <p>Thirdly, That the Reader eſpecially that is leſs able to paſs a Judgment upon an Argument, may reap the full benefit deſigned him by the inſuing Treatiſe, I ſhall here give him a brief Summary of what is more largely diſcourſed herein.</p>
            <p>What I have adventured thus publickly to appear in the defence of, as the Reader will ſee in the main Propoſition, laid as a foundation to the inſuing Diſcourſe, is, the Affirmative of that ſo long and ſo much agitated Queſtion, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Baptiſm of Infants: and all that I have at preſent ingaged in the defence of is, the Affirmative of that Queſtion, as it reſpects the Infant ſeed of Believers, whether both the Parents, or only one be ſo, and that as immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately proceeding from their own loins.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:106624:18"/>
            <p>The method I have proceeded in, the Reader will find in the ſecond page; the neceſſity of proceeding in that method I have already in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timated, which I deſire the Reader to take notice of, that when he finds himſelf led into a large diſcourſe for the confirmation of the two for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ſubordinate Propoſitions there laid down, he may not ſuppoſe himſelf led out of his way, as to the proof of the main Propoſition; thoſe that will find out the mind and will of our Lord Chriſt, concerning the Baptiſm of Infants, muſt firſt know his will concerning their intereſt in the Covenant and the Promiſes thereof. And thoſe that will know the will of Chriſt concerning the Infant ſeed of Believers intereſt in the Covenant and Promiſes thereof, muſt begin at the firſt eſtabliſhment of it with <hi>Abraham,</hi> the common Father of all Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers.</p>
            <p>And that I might proceed with more clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and with greater advantage to the Reader, I have indeavoured fully to explain, at leaſt ſo far as my preſent deſign did require, that grand Promiſe of the Covenant, unto which the three ſubordinate Propoſitions do refer; where the Reader will find, that though God in that term <hi>Seed,</hi> did intend <hi>Abraham</hi>'s whole Seed, or all thoſe he ſhould ſuſtain the relation of a Father unto; yet according to the letter of that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, he had a direct and immediate reſpect to his natural Seed, yet after a different manner, according to a twofold conſideration they fall under.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:106624:18"/>
            <p>Firſt, As his natural Children, as immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly proceeding from his own loins.</p>
            <p>Secondly, As his natural Race and Poſterity, mediately deſcending from him in after Ages.</p>
            <p>Hence the Promiſe is to be conſidered of, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as a definite Promiſe made to his Seed, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtributively taken, and ſo it did teach to all his Children, immediately proceeding from his own loins, and as it did reſpect his natural Seed, only to them, or as an indefinite Promiſe made to his Seed, collectively taken, and ſo it did extend to his whole natural Race and Poſterity; my meaning more plainly is this, That this Promiſe was either ſo made to <hi>Abraham</hi>'s natural Seed, as that each of them, as ſeverally and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly taken, had, as his Seed, an actual intereſt in it: Thus it was only made to his Children, as immediately proceeding from his own loins, or was ſo made to his Seed, as though none in particular had meerly, as his natural Seed, an actual intereſt in it: yet God did thereby ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie and declare his will and purpoſe, to vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe unto them, more generally conſidered, and that as the Seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> that priviledge of a Covenant-relation with himſelf, in defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Promiſes God ſpeaks to particular perſons, in indefinite Promiſes he ſpeaks to none in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, only declares his will and purpoſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning ſuch a ſort or ſpecies of men to whom he makes good his Promiſes, according to the good pleaſure of his own will, in a complyance with his eternal purpoſes and decrees.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:106624:19"/>
            <p>Now in my firſt ſubordinate Propoſition, where <hi>I</hi> ſay, that God intended <hi>Abraham</hi>'s natural Seed, as the immediate and next Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of that Promiſe, I mean his Children, as immediately proceeding from his own loins, and take the Promiſe as a definite Promiſe: This I have proved at large <hi>Chap.</hi> 2. and anſwered what Objections I could imagine might be made againſt it <hi>Chap.</hi> 3. whether <hi>I</hi> muſt refer the Reader for full ſatisfaction.</p>
            <p>And this firſt Propoſition being clear, the way lyes plain to the Second, it being a very rational Suppoſal, that what Priviledge or Bleſſing the Father injoyed, ſhould (ſuppoſing it alike com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petable to them as to him) deſcend to his Seed, as his Heirs; and that believing Gentiles <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>'s myſtical Seed, have this Promiſe of the Covenant given to, and ſettled upon them, and that in the ſame latitude and extent in which it was given to <hi>Abraham</hi> himſelf, as a natural Father of natural Children, only allowing to him, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Father, that preheminence mentioned <hi>page</hi> 65. is evident.</p>
            <p>Firſt, From the very Tenour of the Promiſe, as at firſt made to <hi>Abraham,</hi> with reference to his Seed; it was made to his Seed in their Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations, that is, to them and to their Seed, or their Children, as immediately deſcending from them, for ſo the Covenant was eſtabliſhed, not only with <hi>Abraham</hi> himſelf, but with him and his Seed, in their Generations; and in the ſame extent and latitude the Promiſes of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant muſt be interpreted and underſtood, as the
<pb facs="tcp:106624:19"/>Covenant was eſtabliſhed with <hi>Abraham,</hi> and his Seed in their Generations, ſo the Promiſes of the Covenant were to him, and to his Seed in their Generations; and anſwerably I have ſo expreſt my ſelf throughout the enſuing Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcourſe.</p>
            <p>And here let two things be carefully ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved.</p>
            <p>Firſt, That the Promiſe is made to <hi>Abraham</hi>'s whole Seed, both natural and myſtical, in one and the ſame tenour.</p>
            <p>Hence ſecondly, Look how the Promiſe was to be underſtood, as referring to either kinds or ſpecies of his Seed, ſo it is to be underſtood, as referring to the other; as it was to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, as referring to his natural Seed, ſo it it is to be underſtood, as referring to his myſtical Seed.</p>
            <p>Now that it was, as referring to <hi>Abraham</hi>'s natural Seed, to be underſtood as including Parents and Children, is evident, partly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Promiſe, as thus made, as referring to them, will admit of no other ſence or meaning, conſiſtent with the truth and faithfulneſs of God in his Promiſes, partly becauſe God by his after dealing with the Jews, declares that to be the ſence and meaning of it, and partly becauſe the Prophets ſo expound it as to be fulfilled in Goſpel times.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:106624:20"/>
            <p>Now this Promiſe being ſo to be underſtood, as referring to <hi>Abraham</hi>'s natural Seed, it muſt needs be ſo underſtood, as referring to his myſtical Seed.</p>
            <p>Secondly, This ſecond Propoſition is further evident from the Promiſes and Propheſies of the old Teſtament, relating to new Teſtament times.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, From the expreſs letter of new Teſtament, which affirms poſitively, that the Bleſſing, not this or that part of the Bleſſing, but the Bleſſing ſimply and abſolutely is come upon believing Gentiles by Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, From ſeveral paſſages in the new Teſtament, which though they do not in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs terms hold forth this ſettlement of this Promiſe upon believing Gentiles, yet do plainly imply it.</p>
            <p>For ſatisfaction in all which things, I am ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitated to refer the Reader to the Diſcourſe it ſelf, where he will find them largely ſpoken to.</p>
            <p>Theſe two former Propoſitions being eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed, the third, as I judge, will be queſtioned but by few; and it is evident thus, for as <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>'s whole Seed are in their Generations, that is, both Parents, and immediate Children, under the Promiſe, ſo they are under the Obligation
<pb facs="tcp:106624:20"/>of the Command, to keep the Covenant, that is; the Sign or Token of the Covenant; whence its evident, that as the Covenant that <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>'s Seed, in their Generations, then were, or after ſhould be received into, had, and was to have a Sign or Token annexed to the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of it; ſo that it alwayes was, and is the duty of Parents in Covenant, as to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive and bear that Sign or Token themſelves, ſo to take care that their Infant-ſeed, as joynt Heirs with themſelves of the ſame Promiſes, ſhould receive and bear it; and conſequently that believing Gentiles, they being the myſtical Seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> are ſtill under the Obligation of this Command, and ought to be baptized themſelves (Baptiſm being the preſent Sign and Token of the Covenant, into which they are received) ſo to ſee that their Infant-ſeed be alſo baptized; and as the Promiſe and Command are of an equal extent, ſo intereſt in this Promiſe declares the perſon ſo intereſted to have ſuch a relation to the myſtical Body of Chriſt, as is an undoubted ground of implanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and incorporation into that Body, as viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, by Baptiſm, the Promiſe is made unto Chriſt, and only to him, either perſonally or myſtically conſidered; hence whoever have an intereſt in this Promiſe, they muſt undoubtedly have ſo far relation to Chriſt, as will warrant their implantation into him, as myſtically con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, by Baptiſm, that being the only means appointed by Chriſt, for the implantation of
<pb facs="tcp:106624:21"/>any into his myſtical Body: And further, we find the Apoſtle grounds his Exhortation to Baptiſm, upon intereſt, either in this or ſome other equivalent Promiſe, which he would never have done, had not intereſt in that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe been a ſufficient ground for the application or reception of Baptiſm, but I muſt come to a cloſe.</p>
            <p>And thus Reader, though there are ſome other things I would willingly have ſpoken to, yet I ſhall only acquaint thee with two things, and requeſt two or three things of thee, and then diſmiſs thee, to the ſerious peruſal of what is here tendered to thee.</p>
            <p>Firſt, That which I would acquaint thee with is, That whereas there are ſeveral Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, uſually inſiſted upon, for the proof of the lawfulneſs of this practice of Infant-baptiſm, which thou wilt find in the inſuing Treatiſe, either not at all, or very little touched upon, the reaſon is, not that I judged them impertinent or inſufficient for the proof of that practice; I judge they are full and pertinent, and ſome of them, eſpecially that 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.14. as managed in ſpecial by Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> unan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable, but know, that I do but glean after others, and therefore have eſpecially inſiſted, both in the Arguments I have managed, and Objections I have anſwered, upon ſuch Scriptures as have been more briefly touched
<pb facs="tcp:106624:21"/>upon by them; and would deſire the Reader, as he hath opportunity, to take what they have ſaid from thoſe Scripture, for his more full confirmation (ſuppoſing any doubts may yet remain in his mind) in the Truth that I, in common with them, have pleaded for.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Another thing (Reader) that I would acquaint thee with is this, That whereas 'tis poſſible thou mayeſt have met with ſome Objections which are not here taken notice of; the reaſon is, becauſe I judged them no way able to counter-ballance (in the judgments of any of a competent underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing) the evidence produced, in confirmation of what I have aſſerted, or elſe becauſe they wholly concern others and not my ſelf, in the way I have proceeded in,</p>
            <p>That which I would requeſt of thee is;</p>
            <p>Firſt, That thou take the three ſubordinate Propoſitions in that order I have laid them down, and fully weigh the firſt before thou pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to the ſecond, and then throughly weigh the ſecond before thou proceed to the third, to be ſatisfied in the truth of the firſt will conduce not a little to thy entertaining the evidence produced for the confirmation of the ſecond; and to be well eſtabliſhed in theſe two, will much facillitate thy imbracement of the
<pb facs="tcp:106624:22"/>laſt, wherein the main Truth contended for is contained.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Let me requeſt a favourable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of what weakneſs appears in the management of the whole Debate; thou wilt ſoon find, that the Diſcourſe here put into thy hand comes abroad in a very mean dreſs, and not without many incongruities in expreſſion, and too many interruptions in the ſence; I am unwilling to trouble thee with an account how it is come thus to paſs, let me only ſay, it comes to thee, not only through the hands of a Printer and Corrector, but of more than one Tranſcribers: I have only to requeſt on my own behalf, that thou wilt have ſo much Charity for me, as to judge, it went out of my hands compleat, as to ſence, though not cloathed with ſuch apt and fit expreſſions as it might have been; on their behalf I ſhall requeſt, that thou wilt not lay the blame up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on any one of them, they have all their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective ſhares in it: I hope thou wilt be ſo ingenious, yea, ſo wiſe for thy ſelf, as to look at the ſtrength of the Argument, and not at the defects of the terms.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, I have only this further to requeſt of thee, That thou wilt joyn with me in fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent prayers unto God, like unto whom none can teach, that he will lead both thy ſelf and
<pb facs="tcp:106624:22"/>me into all truth, and through the true knowledge and practice thereof, unto that Aſſembly of the Firſt born, among whom no conteſt, of what kind ſoever, have any place.</p>

<list>
                     <item>Firſt, <hi>That when God, at his firſt entring Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with</hi> Abraham, <hi>promiſed to be a God to him and to his Seed, he inteaded his natural Seed, as the firſt and next Subjects of that Promiſe.</hi>
                     </item>

                     <item>Thirdly, <hi>That all thoſe that are under, or are the actual Subjects of that Promiſe, ought, according to the will of Chriſt, to be bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized.</hi>
                     </item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>To begin with the firſt: <hi>Viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. That when God at his firſt entering Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with <hi>Abraham,</hi> promiſed to be a God to him and to his Seed, he intended his natural Seed as the firſt and next Subjects of that promiſe. <hi>Abraham</hi>'s natural Seed were intended as the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Subjects of that Promiſe, as made to him with reference to his Seed: The Promiſe I have
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:106624:25"/>reference unto, is that in <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.7. where note, that I do not ſay that they are the only, nor yet the principal Subjects of that promiſe, but the immediate and firſt ſubjects, the promiſe in the letter of it did immediately and primarily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect them.</p>
               <p>Now that the ſence and meaning of this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition may more fully appear, and all miſtakes about it be obviated and prevented, I ſhall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire into three things with reference to that Promiſe.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Who are intended in that term Seed, according to the true and full acceptation of it in that promiſe.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Under what notion, or in what ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity <hi>Abraham</hi> is to be conſidered as receiving that promiſe, or having that promiſe made to him by God.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, What is the true intent of that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, in regard of the extent and latitude on the one hand, and the limitations on the other.</p>
               <p>For the firſt, We may obſerve that the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſpeaks of a twofold ſeed of <hi>Abraham.</hi>
               </p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. There is his natural Seed.</item>
                  <item>2. There is his ſpiritual or myſtical Seed.</item>
               </list>
               <p>I ſhall ſpeak to this term Seed, in the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter notion of it, in the firſt place, namely, as it intends or ſignifieth. <hi>Abraham</hi>'s ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual or myſtical ſeed, and thus by ſeed we are to underſtand Chriſt myſtical, or whole Chriſt, as I may ſo ſpeak, including both
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:106624:26"/>Chriſt himſelf as Head, and the whole univerſal Church, conſiſting both of Jews and Gentiles, as the Body: Thus this term Seed is taken, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.16. When <hi>God made promiſe to Abraham, he ſaith not, to thy ſeeds, as of many, but to thy ſeed, which is Chriſt;</hi> id eſt, Chriſt myſtical; and thus the Gentile-Proſelites under the firſt Teſtament, Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants bought with money, or born in the houſe, were accounted for <hi>Abraham</hi>'s ſeed; all thoſe that were admitted into fellowſhip with the people of God in the Covenant, and benefits, bleſſings and priviledges of it, how or by what means ſoever they came to have their admiſſion, were accounted for <hi>Abraham</hi>'s ſeed, and had the actual enjoyment of the good of that Covenant (I mean ſo many as did actually enjoy it) as <hi>Abraham</hi>'s ſeed, by vertue of this Promiſe, <hi>I will be thy God, and the God of thy ſeed:</hi> So be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving Gentiles, or any other, who with them have admiſſion into the Covenant, are accounted for <hi>Abraham</hi>'s ſeed: all that inherit the good promiſed, inheriting of it, under that notion, as his ſeed, by vertue of that forementioned Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe; and thus the natural feed of <hi>Abraham</hi> in another ſenſe were his myſtical ſeed; the whole myſtical body of Chriſt made up, as I have ſaid, both of Jews and Gentiles, is the feed here intended: And this ſpiritual or myſtical ſeed of <hi>Abraham</hi> falls under a two fold conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. As viſible and denominative.</item>
                  <item>2. As inviſible and real.</item>
               </list>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:106624:26"/>
               <p>The Apoſtle gives us this diſtribution of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi>'s ſeed, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.6. <hi>All are not Iſrael that are of Iſrael, &amp;c.</hi> that is, all that are of the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical body of Chriſt as viſible, are not really and truly of his body myſtical as inviſible; the viſible body of Chriſt is of a larger extent than his inviſible; 'tis all one as if the Apoſtle had ſaid, ſome are viſible, and denominatively the ſeed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> who yet are not truly and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally his ſeed: That this is the meaning of the Apoſtle, is evident from the following ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes; of which place more hereafter. Hence this term <hi>ſeed</hi> is to be underſtood ſometimes of his ſeed as viſible and denominative, ſometime of his ſeed as inviſible and real: in the former ſence we are to underſtand it in the place forementi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, <hi>Galat.</hi> 3.16. By Chriſt we are to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the myſtical body of Chriſt as viſible, as is evident, becauſe 'tis by Baptiſm that the ſeveral members are incorporated into, and united unto the body of Chriſt, as here ſpoken of.</p>
               <p>Now Baptiſm doth not properly incorporate into the body of Chriſt as inviſible, but as viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; in the latter ſence we are to underſtand it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.8. Seed here we are to underſtand of the elect, and the meaning is, that all they that are the children of the fleſh are not elected, and in that reſpect not the Children of God, nor ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted for the ſeed.</p>
               <p>Some that are the children of the fleſh are the children of God, and are accounted for the ſeed, but all that are the children of the fleſh are not the children of God, nor accounted for the ſeed;
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:106624:27"/>that is in this ſtrict notion and conſideration of this term ſeed, as it ſignifieth the true internal and inviſible ſeed of <hi>Abraham.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Children of God and Seed here are, <hi>termini convertibiles,</hi> convertible terms: now as perſons are denominated the children of God, either in regard of their viſible and external appearing ſo to be, or in regard of their really and internally being ſuch; (ſaith Chriſt, <hi>'Tis not meet to take the childrens bread and give it to dogs</hi>) it's meant of the things of the Goſpel, primarily appertaining to the Jews, as yet the Covenant-people of God: Now Chriſt calls them, indefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely conſidered, children, that is children of God; when as it appears by their ſo general af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-rejection, but few of them were really and internally the children of God.</p>
               <p>So ſome are the ſeed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and ſo to be accounted, in regard of their viſible and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward appearing ſo to be, who yet are not really and internally his ſeed.</p>
               <p>Others are not only viſibly, and in regard of an external appearance the ſeed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> but are internally and really ſo: Of theſe lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, this term Seed, in this place, is to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood; the children of the promiſe are account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for the Seed, that is, they, and they only are internally the Seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> I mean his ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual and myſtical ſeed, for in that ſence this term Seed is here to be taken.</p>
               <p>Secondly, There is <hi>Abraham</hi>'s natural Seed, only for preventing miſtakes. Note,</p>
               <p>That though I laſtinguiſh between <hi>Abraham</hi>'s
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:106624:27"/>ſpiritual and natural Seed, yet the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them is only reſpective; the ſame per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons might be, and in reſpect of many were both his natural, and alſo his ſpiritual Seed, of which more after: This being noted, I ſay, there is <hi>Abraham</hi>'s natural Seed; and this phraſe, <hi>Abraham</hi>'s natural Seed; may be taken two wayes.</p>
               <p n="1">1. As ſignifying his Children deſcending im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately from his own loins; as it is ſaid of <hi>Iſhmael</hi> he was <hi>Abraham</hi>'s ſeed, <hi>Gen.</hi> 21 13. <hi>He is thy ſeed,</hi> ſaith God to <hi>Abraham,</hi> ſpeaking of <hi>Iſhmael;</hi> and the like may be ſaid of all his other children, they were his natural ſeed.</p>
               <p n="2">2. This phraſe may be taken as ſignifying his whole race or poſterity, or all thoſe that did mediately deſcend from him in after ages: thus <hi>Gen.</hi> 15.18. <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto thy ſeed,</hi> ſaith God, <hi>have I given this land;</hi> it is meant of his race or poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, or his ſeed mediately deſcending from him.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Under what notion or in what ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity <hi>Abraham</hi> is to be conſidered, as receiving this promiſe from God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I</hi> anſwer, That <hi>Abraham</hi> is to be conſidered both as a natural and alſo as a ſpiritual father, or both as a natural Father, and as the Father of the faithful. That God did look on <hi>Abraham</hi> as gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving him this promiſe as the father of the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, is evident from <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.11, 12, 13. and ſome have thought that be was eyed and looked upon only under that notion and in that capacity; but
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:106624:28"/>that he was not only looked upon as the father of the faithful, but as a natural father, is evident by this Argument.</p>
               <p>If <hi>Abraham</hi>'s natural ſeed were intended as the immediate and next ſubjects of this promiſe, and that as ſuch, then <hi>Abraham</hi> as receiving this promiſe, or having this promiſe made to him with reference unto them, muſt needs be eyed and looked upon as a natural father; but the former is true, therefore the latter; the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence in the major propoſition, cannot be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied; for if God intended <hi>Abraham</hi>'s natural ſeed as ſuch, that is, as his natural ſeed, then he muſt needs eye <hi>Abraham</hi> as a natural father, as making this promiſe to him: Now that he did intend <hi>Abraham</hi>'s natural ſeed, will, <hi>I</hi> doubt not, be ſufficiently evident by the proof of this firſt propoſition; and that they were intended as his natural ſeed is evident, becauſe in reſpect of ſome of them, they could be looked upon un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der no other notion, they could not be looked upon as his ſpiritual ſeed, for ſuch they were not, whether we reſpect election or actual faith, take it of <hi>Iſhmael,</hi> he was neither elected, nor had actual faith; as for what ſome think con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning his future repentance 'tis wholly groundleſs, we having no intimation of it throughout the whole Scripture; but the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary is intimated, or ratherr plainly implied in that <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. Now if he (and 'tis like the ſame was the caſe of ſome at leaſt of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Sons by <hi>Keturab</hi>) could not be looked upon as <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>'s ſpiritual ſeed, he muſt needs be looked up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:106624:28"/>under that very notion and conſideration, as his natural ſeed, and as ſuch was intended as one ſubject of that promiſe: And whereas ſome think that the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. expounds this promiſe as made to <hi>Abraham</hi> only as the father of the faithful, 'tis a great miſtake.</p>
               <p>That he was eyed as the father of the faithful is readily granted; but that he was eyed <hi>only</hi> as ſuch a father is denied, and is not in the leaſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timated by the Apoſtle in that place: But not to ſtay on this, it is ſufficiently evident, that as <hi>Abraham</hi> ſuſtained that two-fold relation, <hi>viz.</hi> of a natural and of a ſpiritual father, ſo he was eyed under both notions, as receiving this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, on the behalf or with reference to his ſeed.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, What is the true intent of this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, in regard of the extent and latitude on the one hand, and the limitation on the other.</p>
               <p>Before <hi>I</hi> anſwer this Queſtion, let me only premiſe, that the true determination of this Queſtion conduceth not a little (if I miſtake not) to the clearing up and determining the truth pleaded for, as the not right underſtanding the true intent of this promiſe in the regards mentioned, hath been one conſiderable cauſe of ſo many rejecting the truth we plead for, and their too ready imbracing of the opinion we op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe: Therefore I deſire, that what I have to ſay in anſwer to the Queſtion, may be diligently attended to.</p>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:106624:29"/>
               <p>Firſt then, for the intent of this promiſe, in regard of the extent and latitude of it, take it in theſe two particulars.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That under this term Seed in this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, the whole ſeed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> whether natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral or myſtical, are comprehended: hence though I ſay his natural ſeed, as afore expreſſed, were firſtly and immediately intended as the firſt and next ſubjects of this promiſe; yet not exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding any other, who according to Scripture ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count were to be reckoned unto <hi>Abraham</hi> as his ſeed: As we are not to interpret this term Seed of Chriſt perſonally, ſo as to exclude his myſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal body; nor of his myſtical body, inviſibly and internally conſidered, ſo as to exclude any that are of his myſtical body, as externally and viſibly conſidered; nor of his myſtical body, whether viſible or inviſible, to the excluding of his natural ſeed, whether immediate or mediate: So on the other hand, we muſt not limit it to his immediate ſeed, to the excluding of his mediate, nor to either, ſo as to exclude his myſtical ſeed, but we are to underſtand it in its full latitude and extent, as comprchending and including his whole ſeed.</p>
               <p>That <hi>Abrahams</hi> natural ſeed, as immediately proceeding from his own loins, were intended, will appear by the proof of this firſt propoſition, and is the only thing there to be proved; that his whole race and poſterity as mediately de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcending from him, were intended ſhall be granted.</p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:106624:29"/>
               <p>That <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſpiritual or myſtical feed were intended is ſufficiently evident, as from the denomination they bear of <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed; ſo by their inheriting all the good of the Covenant of Grace, as <hi>Abraham</hi>'s ſeed, by vertue of this very promiſe, as will more fully appear by the proof of the ſecond propoſition; ſo that, I ſay, this term Seed is to be underſtood in ſuch an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent and latitude, as to take in and comprehend <hi>Abraham</hi>'s whole ſeed; but this I ſay, that his natural ſeed were firſtly and immediately in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, as the firſt and next ſubjects of that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Which I deſire with the like care may be attended to: This promiſe, as made to <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>'s whole ſeed, was made to them in their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective generations, under which phraſe, their generations, we muſt underſtand Parents, and their Children immediately deſcending from their own loins: ſo that the promiſe runs to <hi>Abraham</hi>'s ſeed in their generations, that is, to all his ſeed, and to their reſpective natural ſeed in conjunction with themſelves.</p>
               <p>Secondly, We may conſider the intent of this promiſe, in regard of the limitations of it; and thus this promiſe had a two fold limita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. It had a limitation in regard of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons actually intereſted in it.</item>
                  <item>2. In regard of the continuance of that their intereſt in, and their actual poſſeſſion and injoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:106624:30"/>of the good of the promiſe they were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore intereſted in.</item>
               </list>
               <p n="1">1. Then I ſay, this promiſe was given to <hi>Abraham</hi> under a limitation, in regard of the perſons actually intereſſed in it; and thus it was limited to <hi>Abraham</hi>'s ſeed in their reſpective generations, including, as before, parents and their immediate children; my meaning is, that this promiſe taken as a definite promiſe made to <hi>Abraham,</hi> with reference to his ſeed diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively taken, that is, as they were ſeverally and each in particular intended in it, ſo it did reach to and take in only <hi>Abraham</hi>'s ſeed in their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective generations, they and their immediate children.</p>
               <p>It's true, as it was an indefinite promiſe made to <hi>Abraham</hi>'s natural ſeed, collectively or gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally taken, ſo it had reſpect vnto his whole race and poſterity, whether mediately or immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſcending from him; but I ſay, take it as a definite promiſe made to <hi>Abraham</hi>'s ſeed, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtributively or particularly taken: ſo it was made only to each of them reſpectively in their generations; that is, to them and their imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate children. To explain my meaning, take for inſtance any parent that was related to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> as one of his ſeed, let <hi>Iſaac</hi> be the inſtance: <hi>Iſaac</hi> was one of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s ſeed, and as ſo related to <hi>Abraham</hi> was under this promiſe, That God would be a God to him in his generations: Now as in this phraſe, his genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, <hi>Iſaac,</hi> and his children immediately de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcending
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:106624:30"/>from him in after ages, were perſonally included, or particularly intended in it, it was to <hi>Iſaac,</hi> as <hi>Abraham</hi>'s ſeed, in his generations, to him and to his immediate children: As this promiſe is to be underſtood in the extent men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, as including parents and children; ſort is not to be inlarged beyond what was the true intendment of God in it. Now though God made it to each of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s ſeed, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther immediately deſcending from his own loins, or otherwiſe ſtanding related to him, as his ſeed in their generations, yet his intendment was not, that all that ſhould ſucceſſively, in follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ages, deſcend from them reſpectively, ſhould be included as joynt ſubjects with them of this promiſe, ſo as to claim, by vertue of their rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion unto them, a joynt right and title to the promiſe with them; his intendment only was, that his ſeed in their generations, that is, pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, and immediate children, ſhould be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted as joynt ſubjects of this promiſe; and in this regard this promiſe was one and the ſame, or ran in one and the ſame tenour to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and to his ſeed, only allowing to <hi>Abraham</hi> ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of preheminence (hereafter to be explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) above any of his ſeed; but otherwiſe the promiſe, for the ſubſtance of it, was one and the ſame, or ran in one and the ſame tenour to both; for the promiſe was to <hi>Abraham</hi> and his ſeed; which promiſe, as a definite promiſe made to him, with reference to his natural ſeed, diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butively taken, extended no further than to his natural ſeed, immediately deſcending from his
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:106624:31"/>own loins; and was not to his whole race and poſtcrity, no not by <hi>Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> as many ſeem to have very much miſtaken, to the no lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle obſcuring the truth we now plead for: I ſtill grant that the promiſe, as an indefinite promiſe, had reſpect to his whole race and poſterity, and that not only by <hi>Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> but <hi>Iſhmael</hi> and his Sons by <hi>Keturab:</hi> but yet as a definite promiſe, as before expreſt, it extended no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than to his own immediate children, even <hi>Jacob</hi> himſelf had not an actual intereſt in this promiſe in his infancy, as he was one of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>'s natural poſterity, but as he was included in the promiſe as made to <hi>Iſaac</hi> (one of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>'s ſeed) in his generations; and in the very ſame tenour the promiſe runs to <hi>Abraham</hi>'s ſeed, That as God was a God to <hi>Abraham</hi> and his natural ſeed, ſo he would be a God to them and their natural ſeed, that is, to them in their generations: But that's the firſt limitation of this promiſe made to <hi>Abraham,</hi> with reference to his ſeed.</p>
               <p n="2">2. This promiſe was given unto <hi>Abraham</hi> under a limitation, in regard of the continuance of his ſeeds intereſt in, and their actual poſſeſſion and injoyment of the good promiſed, that they had afore an intereſt in; and thus it was limit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted both to the ſeed and their reſpective gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, as they ſhould become, and continue to be <hi>Abraham</hi>'s myſtical or ſpiritual ſeed, through their perſonal entring into, and walking in the ſteps of the faith and obedience of their father <hi>Abraham.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:106624:31"/>
               <p>Take <hi>Iſaac,</hi> he was one of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural ſeed, and as ſuch was intended in this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, That God would be a God to him in his generations; that is, as before expreſſed, to him, and to his immediate children, but now the continuance of his intereſt in, and actual enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the good of the promiſe, as grown up to years of maturity, did depend upon, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily require his perſonal acceptation and performance of the conditions of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, into which he had, as one of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s natural ſeed, admiſſion in his infancy; hence his childrens actual intereſt in, and right unto the promiſe (which was in part the good of the promiſe, as made to him) depended upon his myſtical relation to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and not meerly upon his natural relation to <hi>Abraham.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For if ſo be he had not accepted of, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed the conditions of the Covenant, his children had wholly loſt that their right to and intereſt in the promiſe, which was granted unto them with himſelf, as included in his generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
               <p>And hence it will undeniably follow, that all <hi>Abraham</hi>'s natural race and poſterity by <hi>Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> held their intereſt in, and right to the promiſe, and enjoyed the good promiſed, either as <hi>Abraham</hi>'s myſtical ſeed, or as included in the generations of thoſe that were his myſtical ſeed, for their bare natural relation to <hi>Abraham</hi> was not enough to preſerve their own intereſt, nor convey a right to and intereſt in the promiſe to their children.</p>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:106624:32"/>
               <p>And from all it will follow, which I deſire may be diligently obſerved, that the caſe of believing Gentiles, ſuppoſing the promiſe to run in the ſame extent and latitude to them that it did run in to the natural poſterity of <hi>Abraham</hi> (as I doubt not, through di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine aſſiſtance, ſhall be made evident) that it doth.</p>
               <p>And the caſe of the Jews, or natural poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of <hi>Abraham,</hi> is one and the ſame, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of their own and their childrens right to, and intereſt in the promiſe: the natural poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of <hi>Abraham,</hi> or the Jews, when once grown up, held their intereſt in, and right to the promiſe, not barely as his natural poſterity, but as accepting of, and performing the conditions of the Covenant, ſo far, as not abſolutely to dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anul that their intereſt in it, and conſequently as <hi>Abrahams</hi> myſtical ſeed, and as ſuch they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed a right to, and intereſt in the ſame Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant and Promiſe, themſelves were under to their children.</p>
               <p>And the ſame is the caſe of believing Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, they have a right to, und intereſt in the promiſe, as accepting of, and performing the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of the Covenant, and as ſo doing, convey an intereſt in, and right to the ſame Covenant and Promiſe, they themſelves are under, to their children, by vertue of this promiſe as made unto <hi>Abraham,</hi> with reference to his ſeed in their ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations.</p>
               <p>The truth of what is now aſſerted concerning the extent and limitations of this premiſe, will
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:106624:32"/>I doubt not ſufficiently appear when I come to the proof of the ſecond Propoſition.</p>
               <p>The ſum of what hath been hitherto ſaid, take in brief in theſe five Concluſions.</p>
               <p>Firſt, That when God entred Covenant with <hi>Abraham,</hi> and promiſed to be a God to him and his ſeed in their generations, he intended, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the full latitude and extent of that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, his whole ſeed, whether Jews or Gentiles, grown perſons, or infants, all thoſe who, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Scripture account, ſhould bear the denomination of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s ſeed, how, or by what means ſoever that denomination was applicable unto them, were comprehended un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this term Seed.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Although the promiſe extend to, and ought to be interpreted of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s whole ſeed, as now expreſſed, yet God in it had a peculiar and ſpecial regard to his natural ſeed, whether immediately or mediately deſcending from him.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, That the natural ſeed, race or po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity of <hi>Abraham</hi> injoyed an intereſt in, and right to this promiſe, and together therewith a Covenant-ſtate and relation God-ward ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively, for ſo long time; nor barely as his natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ſeed, but as his mystical ſeed; that is, through parents ſo far performing the conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Covenant, as to preſerve their own Covenant ſtate and relation themſelves, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veying to their children the ſame intereſt in, and right to the Covenant and Promiſes thereof that themſelves had.</p>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:106624:33" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <p>Fourthly, That in and among the ſeed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> as conſidered theſe various wayes aforementioned, there is a certain number afore choſen and elected of God, to whom in a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar and ſpecial manner, this term Seed is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicable, and that in regard of their eternal de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignment to enjoy the good promiſed; the whole number of thoſe, whom viſibly and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominatively were to be accounted for <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>'s ſeed, were intended in this promiſe; yet the promiſe was not intended by God infullibly to ſecure the good promiſed to every individual perſon, who in regard of an external and viſible denomination, were to be accounted for his ſeed, but there is a certain number choſen of God from eternity, actually to inherit the good pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed, who in time are ſavingly wrought upon, and theſe, in a ſpecial and peculiar manner, are in the eſteem of God accounted for the ſeed.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, That yet they were the natural ſeed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> as immediately deſcending from his own loins, who were intended in this promiſe, as the next and immediate ſubjects of it, and that the natural ſeed of <hi>Abraham</hi> intended in this firſt Propoſition.</p>
               <p>And that is the thing that I ſhall now apply my ſelf to the proof of.</p>

                           <hi>2.</hi> More particularly, by inſtancing in ſuch of his natural ſeed, as upon a ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, of whoſe being intended in the Promiſe, it will neceſſarily follow, that all his natural ſeed were in like manner intended, and proving that they were indeed intended by God in that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe.</item>

                  </p>
               </argument>
               <p>THat when God, at his firſt entring Covenant with <hi>Abraham,</hi> promiſed to be a God to him and his ſeed, intended his natural ſeed, as immediately deſcending from his own loins, as the immediate and next ſubjects of that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, may be evinced two wayes:
<list>
                     <item>1. More generally.</item>
                     <item>2. More particularly.</item>

               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:106624:34"/>
               <p n="1">1. More generally: And thus I ſhall only offer a two-fold Argument.</p>
               <p>The firſt ſhall be taken from the Promiſe it ſelf, as taken according to the literal and moſt proper ſence and ſignification of thoſe words it is expreſt in, and it is this:</p>
               <p>What God ſpeaks unto men ought to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted and underſtood according to the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teral and moſt proper ſenſe and ſignification of thoſe words he expreſſeth himſelf in, unleſs there be ſome neceſſary Reaſon enforcing a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion from that literal and moſt proper ſence and ſignification of his words.</p>
               <p>But according to the literal and moſt proper ſence and ſignification of the words of this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, now made to <hi>Abraham</hi> his natural ſeed, immediately deſcending from his own loins, and that univerſally one as well as the other muſt be intended, as the immediate and next ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of it, and there is no Reaſon enforcing our receſſion from that literal and moſt proper ſence and ſignification of his words: Therefore we ought to interpret and underſtand them, as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending his immediate natural ſeed, as the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate and next ſubjects of that Promiſe. When God ſaid to <hi>Abraham,</hi> He would be a God to him and to his ſeed in their generations, ſurely the literal and moſt proper ſence and ſignification of the words, wherein the Promiſe is expreſſed, muſt needs lead him to apply it as to himſelf, ſo to his immediate natural ſeed, and that univerſally.</p>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:106624:34"/>
               <p>It's true, God promiſed to <hi>Abraham,</hi> That he <hi>would make him the Father of many Nations;</hi> and doubtleſs <hi>Abraham</hi> did underſtand the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, as reaching and taking in all thoſe he ſhould ſuſtain the relation of a Father unto.</p>
               <p>But no Reaſon could be drawn from the words of the Promiſe it ſelf, why either <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> or any other ſince, ſhould underſtand it, as intending his remote or adopted ſeed, to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding of his own natural ſeed, as immediately deſcending from him.</p>
               <p>Now that what God ſpeaks ought to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted, as before expreſt, cannot be doubted by any.</p>
               <p>And therefore all that poſſibly can be object<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, for the invalidating this argument, is, That there is a neceſſity of interpreting and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding this Promiſe, as now made to <hi>Abraham,</hi> differently from what the literal and proper ſignification of the words ſeems to import: Whether there be any ſuch neceſſity ſhall be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered by and by.</p>
               <p>In the mean time let it be obſerved, that we have the letter of the Promiſe on our ſide, as to the interpretation put upon it.</p>
               <p>The ſecond Argument ſhall be taken from <hi>Abraham</hi>'s applying of the ſeal or token of that Covenant, whereof the Promiſe, under conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, was a principal part, to his immediate and natural ſeed, and that univerſally to one as well as to another, and that under that very notion and conſideration, as the ſeal and token of the Covenant.</p>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:106624:35"/>
               <p>Hence I argue,</p>
               <p>If <hi>Abraham,</hi> according to the will and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment of God, did apply the ſeal or token of that Covenant (wherein the Promiſe, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der conſideration, was one ſpecial Article on Gods part) to all his immediate natural ſeed, to one as well as to the other, and that under that very notion and conſideration, as the ſeal or token of the Covenant, then God in that Promiſe muſt needs intend all his immediate na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural ſeed, as the Subjects of it: but the former is true, therefore the latter.</p>
               <p>The Aſſumption ſure cannot once be queſtion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by any that have read over the Book of <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſis:</hi> yet <hi>exabundanti.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Let me touch upon the proof of it in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral branches or clauſes of it: It contains three Branches.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That <hi>Abraham</hi> did apply the ſeal or token of that Covenant, wherein this Promiſe is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, unto all his immediate natural ſeed: If that term Seal offend any, let them keep only to the other word token; it's all one as to my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent purpoſe. That Circumciſion was the ſeal or token of the Covenant, that God now entred into with <hi>Abraham</hi> and his ſeed, is paſt all doubt; 'tis expreſly called, <hi>The Taken of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, Gen.</hi> 17.11. <hi>Ye ſhall circumciſe the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skin of your fleſh, and it ſhall be a token of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant between me and you.</hi> A token of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant: Of what Covenant? Why, of that, no doubt, now eſtabliſhed with <hi>Abraham,</hi> and
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:106624:35"/>his ſeed in their generations: and that <hi>Abraham</hi> did apply this token of the Covenant to all his natural ſeed, is evident, partly from Gods Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, read that <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.9, 10, 11, 12, 13. partly from <hi>Abraham</hi>'s practice; mention is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly made of his circumciſing of <hi>Iſhmael</hi> and <hi>Iſaac,</hi> verſe 23 with <hi>Gen</hi> 21.4.</p>
               <p>But ſome will ſay, There's is no mention of his circumciſing his Sons by <hi>Keturah.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To that I anſwer, No more is there mention made of <hi>Jacob</hi>'s circumciſion, nor of his twelve Sons circumciſion, and yet ſhall it be queſtioned, whether they were circumciſed or no? The command of God engaging it and the teſtimony that God gives of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s faithfulneſs, and his circumciſing all his male ſervants, is ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abundant evidence that he did circumciſe them, though their circumciſion be not mentioned. So that it's undeniable, that Abraham did apply the ſeal or token of the Covenant to all his Seed, immediately deſcending from his own loins.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That <hi>Abraham</hi> did apply this ſeal or token of the Covenant to his ſeed, under that very notion and conſideration as the ſeal or token of it, this is evident thus:</p>
               <p>Look under what notion God commanded it to be applyed, under that notion and conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <hi>Abraham</hi> did apply it: That <hi>Abraham</hi> did apply it under that notion as the ſeal or token of the Covenant, as he was commanded, is unque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtronable, from the forementioned teſtimony that God gave of him.</p>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:106624:36"/>
               <p>Now that God did command it to be applyed under that notion and conſideration, is evident, becauſe in the Command, concerning the appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of it, he calls it the Covenant, <hi>My Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant ſhall be in your fleſh:</hi> that is, the token of my Covenant, and that as the token of it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That what <hi>Abraham</hi> did was according to the will and appointment of God, this is paſt doubt by what is already ſaid; <hi>Abraham</hi> acted in circumciſing his Children according to the expreſs command he had received from God; ſo that the Aſſumption is in every branch and clauſe of it undeniable.</p>
               <p>Secondly, For the Conſequence in the Major Propoſition, <hi>viz.</hi> That in as much as <hi>Abraham</hi> did apply the ſeal or token of the Covenant, as now expreſſed, it muſt needs follow, that God in this Promiſe did intend his immediate natural ſeed, as the firſt ſubjects of it: The validity of this Conſequence, if any ſhall queſtion it, will appear theſe three wayes.</p>
               <p>Firſt, From the ſameneſs of the word uſed in the Promiſe and in the Command, concerning the application of the ſeal: The Promiſe is, <hi>To thee and to thy Seed;</hi> the Command is, <hi>Thou ſhalt therefore keep my Covenant, thou and thy Seed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now who can once imagine, that this term Seed ſhould be uſed reſtrictively in the Promiſe, as intending only one or more of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Children; excluſive of the reſt, and univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:106624:36"/>in the Command, as intending all his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</p>
               <p>That it is to be underſtood univerſally in the Command, is paſt all doubt; God explains him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in the very next words, <hi>Every Man child amongſt you ſhall be circumciſed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now thoſe that ſhould take this term Seed reſtrictively in the Promiſe, had need for their acquitment in the ſight of God for their ſo doing, have as clear a warrant from God as <hi>Abraham</hi> had, to take it in an unlimited ſence in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand; whether they have ſo or no, concerns them to look to it.</p>
               <p>Secondly, It appears from hence, becauſe otherwiſe the ſeal or token of the Covenant ſhould, and that according to the appointment of God, be apylyed to ſome, unto whom it ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified and betokened nothing at all; it ſhould be applyed, and that as the ſeal or token of the Covenant, to ſome wholly unintereſſed and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concerned in the Covenant, of which it was the ſeal or token.</p>
               <p>Now how remote is it from a rational proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility; that God ſhould appoint the token of the Covenant, and that under that notion and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, as the token of it, to be applyed to perſons neither externally nor internally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſſed or concerned in the Covenant, of which it was the token, let but any ſober perſon exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe his reaſon, and ſee whether there be ſo much as the remoteſt probability of it.</p>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:106624:37"/>
               <p>It's true, God might have commanded the ſame thing to have been acted upon perſons, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der another notion or conſideration, for ſome ſpecial end appointed by himſelf; but that he ſhould appoint the ſame action, with reference unto all, and that to be performed under one and the ſame notion and conſideration, and yet, that ſome of theſe ſhould be in Covenant, and others not at all concerned in it, is a thing not to be ſuppoſed by any man, that hath the free uſe of his own reaſon.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, It appears, becauſe in caſe the ſeal or token of the Covenant had been applyed to any in the ſence afore expreſſed, no way intereſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed or concerned in the Covenant, nor the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe thereof, then God had ſpoken that which had been abſolutely falſe, which far be it from any man, that pretends to Chriſtianity, once to imagine: yet the denying the ſame perſons to be intended in the Promiſe, that were intended in the Command, concerning the application of the ſeal, doth neceſſarily it for it. For pray ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve it: Saith the Lord of Circumciſion, <hi>It ſhall be the token of the Covenant between me and you, Gen.</hi> 17.11. Now had any of theſe male-children, whoſe circumciſion is commanded in the foregoing verſes, been wholly unconcerned in the Covenant, then it could not have been a token of the Covenant between God and them; and conſequently it had been falſe to ſay; it ſhould be a token of the Covenant between him and them: for according to the opinions in this
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:106624:37"/>firſt Propoſition oppoſed, it was not the token of the Covenant between God and them, in as much as the male-children, now intended, were not in the Covenant, or there was no Covenant between God and them.</p>
               <p>Now for God to command, that every Male-child amongſt them ſhould be circumciſed, and then to ſay of Circumciſion, as ſo applyed, that it ſhould be a token of the Covenant between him and them, whereas there was ſome of thoſe Male-children wholly unintereſſed in this Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, or betwixt God and whom there was no ſuch Covenant, had been abſolutely falſe, for it was not, it could not poſſibly be a token of the Covenant between God and them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween him and whom there was no Covenant: there can be no token of a Covenant between whom there is no Covenant made: But now ſaith God, <hi>It ſhall be a token of the Covenant be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween me and them:</hi> So that to grant, that <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> according to the will and appointment of God did apply the ſeal or token of the Covenant to all his immediate natural Seed, and that as the ſeal or token of the Covenant, and yet to affirm, that ſome of his natural Seed were not in Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, or not intended in the Promiſes thereof, is to aſcribe falſhood unto God, or to charge him with ſpeaking what was abſolutely falſe.</p>
               <p>And therefore undoubtedly <hi>Abraham</hi>'s whole natural Seed were intended in the Promiſe, as the immediate and next ſubjects of it.</p>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:106624:38"/>
               <p>Secondly, Let us inſtance in ſuch of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>'s immediate Children, as upon ſuppoſition of their being intended in the Promiſe, under conſideration, it will undoubtedly follow, that all his immediate Children were in it: and thus I ſhall inſtance in theſe two of his Children, that the Scripture makes more frequent mention of, <hi>viz. Iſhmael</hi> and <hi>Iſaac:</hi> and I ſhall begin with the latter firſt.</p>
               <p>Firſt, That <hi>Iſaac</hi> was intended in this Promiſe, as one of the Subjects of it, is fully evident from that one paſſage of God to <hi>Abraham, Gen.</hi> 21.12. cited and expounded by the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.7 8. <hi>In</hi> Iſaac <hi>ſhall thy ſeed be called.</hi> We read in the tenth verſe, <hi>Sarahs</hi> requeſt to <hi>Abraham,</hi> to caſt out <hi>Hagar</hi> and her Son <hi>Iſhmael:</hi> Now this was grievous to <hi>Abraham.</hi> God had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to be a God to him and to his ſeed: <hi>Iſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mael</hi> is one of his Seed; hence to caſt him out, and thereby diſinherit him of the bleſſing pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed, was very grievous to <hi>Abraham.</hi> Now God to allay <hi>Abraham</hi>'s grief tells him, Though he ſhould anſwer <hi>Sarahs</hi> requeſt, yet <hi>in</hi> Iſaac <hi>ſhould his Seed be called;</hi> that is, in <hi>Iſaac</hi> and his line the Promiſe ſhould have its accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Though <hi>Iſhmael</hi> was caſt out, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by diſinherited of the good promiſed, yet the Promiſe ſhould ſtand firm, and receive its full accompliſhment in <hi>Iſaac</hi> and his line, which could not have been, had he not been intended in the Promiſe: had not <hi>Iſaac</hi> been intended, not excluſive of others, but incluſive of himſelf,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:106624:38"/>the Promiſe could not have received its accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment in him, but had failed in the ejection of <hi>Iſhmael:</hi> and hence the Apoſtle tells us, That <hi>Abraham</hi> ſojourned in <hi>Canaan,</hi> as a Stranger in a ſtrange Land, with <hi>Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> heirs with him of the ſame Promiſe: Of what Promiſe? Surely of that, wherein God engaged himſelf to be a God to him, and to his Seed, and to give him and them the Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> for an ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting poſſeſſion: both theſe Promiſes are joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed together as one Promiſe, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.6. Now of this Promiſe <hi>Iſaac</hi> was an heir with <hi>Abraham,</hi> and therefore muſt needs be included in it as one of the Subjects of it.</p>
               <p>Secondly, That <hi>Iſhmael</hi> was intended as part of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Seed in this Promiſe, is evident by this one Conſideration.</p>
               <p>Not to multiply, where truth is ſufficiently evident, <hi>viz.</hi> His ejection out of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Family, and his being diſinherited of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant and Promiſe thereby.</p>
               <p>It's true, his bare ejection out of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Family would not demonſtrate his being in <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Covenant, and under the Promiſe thereof, while in his Family he had Servants in his houſe, who yet might be after caſt out, but that would not conclude them to have had an intereſt in his Covenant: but now as by that his ejection out of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Family, he was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inherited of, or diſintereſſed in the Promiſe, or was diveſted of his right and title to it, doth undeniably evidence his right and title to it
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:106624:39"/>antecedent to that his ejection; for he could not be diveſted or diſinherited of that he never had, or was never an heir unto.</p>
               <p>Now that <hi>Iſhmael,</hi> with and by means of his rejection out of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Family, was diveſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of a right and title he afore had to the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, and to the promiſes thereof, is evident by theſe two Reaſons.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Becauſe his ejection was typical of their ejection out of the Goſpel Church, and rejection from the benefits and bleſſings of the Covenant of Grace, who under a Profeſſion of Chriſtianity, or of being the Covenant-people of God, do adhere to the Law for Righteouſneſs and Life. That <hi>Iſhmael</hi>'s caſting out of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Family was thus typical, is expreſly affirmed by the Apoſtle, <hi>Gal</hi> 4.30. compared with the foregoing Context.</p>
               <p>Now his bare ejection out of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, could not have made him a proper type of the perſons beforementioned, in as much as then there had been no direct Analogy or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion between the type and antitype. How his meer caſting out of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Family ſhould repreſent, or foreſhew, and predict the ejection of the perſons forementioned out of the Goſpel Church, and diveſtment of all title to the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits and bleſſings of the Covenant of Grace can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be imagined; for as much as others might be caſt out of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Family, whoſe ejection was not of any ſuch typical ſignification.</p>
               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:106624:39"/>
               <p>Secondly, That <hi>Iſhmael,</hi> together with and by means of his ejection out of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, was diveſted of a right and title, which, while in his houſe, he had to the Covenant and promiſes thereof, is evident, becauſe <hi>Sarah,</hi> in her requeſt to <hi>Abraham</hi> to caſt him out, propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed that as her end, <hi>viz.</hi> That he might not iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herit with <hi>Iſaac</hi> her Son; <hi>Gen.</hi> 21.10. <hi>Caſt out this bond woman and her ſon, for the ſon of the bond-woman ſhall not be heir with my ſon, even with Iſaac:</hi> And that it was the good promiſed in this Covenant, that ſhe deſires his diſinhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riting of, is evident by <hi>Abraham</hi>'s griefs; had it been only the temporal poſſeſſions of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> his not inheriting of which ſhe propoſeth as her end, in deſiring his ejection, there had been no reaſon of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s grief, in as much as he was under the promiſe of outward bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings, notwithſtanding that his ejection: Now there had been no reaſon for <hi>Sarah,</hi> to propoſe that end in her requeſt, to have him caſt out, unleſs he had, and would continue to have had, during his abode in the houſe, a like viſible right and title to the Promiſe that <hi>Iſaac</hi> had, ſhe might have deſired his ejection for ſome other reaſon, but for that, that he might not inherit with <hi>Iſaac,</hi> ſhe could not rationally do, it would have been an impertinent reaſon, for her to have deſired his ejection, that he might not inherit with her own Son, in caſe he had no right nor title to the promiſed Inheritance, whilſt in the houſe.</p>
               <p>For a woman to deſire her Husband to caſt
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:106624:40"/>out a Servant out of the family for that reaſon, that he might not inherit with her own Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, when as whether he ſhould continue or be caſt out of the family, he could lay no claim to to the Inheritance, would be ridiculous: Hence <hi>Sarahs</hi> pleading that reaſon, or propounding that end of her requeſt, plainly implyes, that <hi>Iſhmael,</hi> during his abode in <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Family, had at reaſt a viſible right and title to the inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance promiſed, which would be diſanulled by that his ejection: Hence it is evident, <hi>Iſhamel,</hi> as well as <hi>Iſaac,</hi> was intended in that Promiſe, and that both were joynt Heirs to, or Subjects of that Promiſe, as externally made to <hi>Abraham,</hi> with reference to his Seed.</p>
               <p>Now then ſeeing theſe two, <hi>viz. Iſhmael</hi> and <hi>Iſaac,</hi> were intended, there can be no reaſon imagined, why we ſhould ſuppoſe <hi>Abraham</hi>'s other Children to be excluded; for they were either elected or not elected; if they were, their caſe was the ſame with <hi>Iſaac</hi>'s, if not, their caſe was the ſame with <hi>Iſhmael</hi>'s; and therefore both <hi>Iſhmael</hi> and <hi>Iſaac</hi> being intended, there is no ſhew of reaſon to ſuppoſe the other excluded; but we may partly from the parity of their ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, with the caſe of the one or the other of theſe two, and partly from the evidence of the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going Arguments, poſitively conclude, that all <hi>Abraham</hi>'s natural Seed, according to the intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of this firſt propoſition, were intended in this promiſe, as the firſt and next ſubjects of it: but let that ſuffice for the proof of the firſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>Objections againſt the firſt ſubordinate Propoſition conſidered and anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THus having ſeen ſomewhat (for much more might be produced) of that evidence the Scriptures give in, for the confirmation of this firſt Propoſition, I ſhall now conſider the Objections I have yet met with, or can poſſibly imagine may be made, that have any appearance of weight in them, againſt the truth hitherto aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted and pleaded for: That which I plead for is this, That God in that grand Promiſe of the Covenant, wherein he engaged himſelf to be a God to <hi>Abraham</hi> and his ſeed in their generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, intended his natural Seed, and that indefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely one as well as another, immediately pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from his own loins, as the immediate and next Subjects of it. Now at leaſt ſome. (I ſuppoſe not all) of thoſe, whoſe judgment and practice vary from the truth pleaded for, will contend, that this term Seed is to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood in a reſtrained ſenſe, as only intended of one or more of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s immediate Children, to the excluding of the reſt, and that it is not to be extended to all indefinitely. But yet, I
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:106624:41"/>ſuppoſe, they are not agreed among themſelves, which to aſſign as the proper Subjects of this Promiſe; ſome have denied <hi>Iſaac</hi> to be the ſeed or part of the ſeed here intended; others, and I ſuppoſe the major part of our oppoſers, deny that <hi>Iſhmael</hi> was intended, or ought to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted as part of the ſeed here ſpoken of; As for thoſe that judge <hi>Iſaac</hi> was not intended in this Promiſe, the only ground they go upon, for ought I have yet met with, is this Suppoſition, <hi>viz.</hi> That God made a twofold Covenant with <hi>Abraham</hi> and his Seed, the one a legal or tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Covenant, conſiſting only in temporal promiſes, and requiring only an external obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; the other a Covenant of Grace, conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of ſpiritual promiſes, and requiring internal and ſpiritual obedience; and they conceive, that this Covenant entred with <hi>Abraham</hi> and his Seed, mentioned <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.7. was only a legal or temporal Covenant; and that the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Grace is that formerly ſpoken of, <hi>Gen.</hi> 12.3. and again re-eſtabliſhed with <hi>Iſaac</hi> at the nineteenth verſe of this ſeventeenth Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: And then the Objection that the perſons of this perſwaſion raiſe againſt our Propoſition in the ſenſe given, is to this purpoſe: That this term Seed is not to be underſtood in that exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive ſenſe given of it, in as much as this Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, mentioned in this ſeventh verſe, was only a temporal or legal Covenant eſtabliſhed with <hi>Abraham,</hi> as a natural Father, and his fleſhly ſeed, and not the Covenant of Grace, eſtabliſhed with him, as a ſpiritual Father, and with his
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:106624:41"/>ſpiritual ſeed, now <hi>Iſaac</hi> being a Child of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, and conſequently to be accounted of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>'s ſpiritual ſeed, could not be intended in that promiſe, which alone intended his fleſhly of natural ſeed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> I anſwer, That <hi>Iſaac</hi> in particular was intended in this Promiſe, and that as a principal Subject of it, as it reſpected <hi>Abraham</hi>'s natural ſeed, hath been already proved, and as for the Objection now made, it involves the framers of it in ſuch abſurdities and contradictions, and ſuppoſing it granted, would ſo little advantage the cauſe, the promotion of which is in the ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate deſign of it aimed at, that it needs no reply at all, I ſhall therefore only in a direct oppoſition to that Suppoſition, this Objection is grounded upon, affirm, that there was but one Covenant eſtabliſhed between God and <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> and his ſeed, and that was a Covenant of Grace, and the very ſame for ſubſtance that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers are now under, and conſequently that that Promiſe in <hi>Gen.</hi> 12.3. was either a branch of this Covenant, or rather the very ſame pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe with this, under conſideration, expreſſed in other terms. And that that Covenant men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned verſe 19. is the ſame with this mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ver. 7. There are ſeveral branches of this ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Aſſertion: As,</p>
               <p>Firſt, That there was but one Covenant made and eſtabliſhed between God and <hi>Abraham,</hi> with reference to himſelf and his ſeed; I do not ſay,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:106624:42"/>that there was but one Covenant made with the ſeed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> underſtanding that term Seed of his Race or Poſterity in following ages, but I ſay, there was but one eſtabliſhed with <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> wherein himſelf, in common with his Seed; was concerned; now this appears from the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant phraſe of Scripture alwayes, where ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Covenant made with <hi>Abraham,</hi> ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the ſingular number, the Covenant, and not in the plural, Covenants.</p>
               <p>Secondly, I ſay, this was a Covenant of Grace.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, That it was the very ſame Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant for ſubſtance that Believers are now un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, That that Promiſe, <hi>Gen.</hi> 12.3. is one branch of the Covenant now eſtabliſhed with <hi>Abraham</hi> and his Seed, or rather the ſame Promiſe with this mentioned, in our firſt Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition expreſſed in different terms; theſe things I ſhall ſpeak to hereafter, and the truth of them will, I doubt not, fully appear by the proof of the ſecond Propoſition, and therefore <hi>I</hi> ſhall ſay nothing to them at preſent.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, That the Covenant mentioned verſe 19. is the very ſame mentioned verſe 7. this is ſufficiently evident to any that will but read the whole Chapter. In the former part of the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, we read how God promiſeth to eſtabliſh his
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:106624:42"/>Covenant with <hi>Abraham</hi> and his Seed in their generations, for an everlaſting Covenant, that is, to endure while <hi>Abraham</hi> ſhould have a Seed upon earth: Now at verſe 19. the Lord ſhews <hi>Abraham,</hi> in which of his Seed, and his Line, or poſterity this Promiſe ſhould take place, and have its accompliſhment, and that was <hi>Iſaac.</hi> Therefore obſerve how the Text runs, <hi>And God ſaid,</hi> Sarah <hi>ſhall bear thee a Son, and I will eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh my Covenant with him.</hi> Mark, here is no intimation of any other Covenant, different from that before mentioned; he doth not ſay, I will alſo make, or I will eſtabliſh a Covenant, or ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Covenant, but <hi>I will eſtabliſh my Covenant:</hi> What Covenant? Doubtleſs that before entred in with <hi>Abraham,</hi> with reference to his Seed in their generations; and this limitation of the Covenant, as afore made and eſtabliſhed, with <hi>Abraham,</hi> in reference to his Seed in their gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, unto <hi>Iſaac</hi> alone, doth plainly imply, that in the firſt eſtabliſhment of it, <hi>Abraham</hi>'s whole Seed, as immediately proceeding from his own loms, were included and intended; for what need an explanatory limitation of it, in regard of the eſtabliſhment thereof, for an ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Covenant to <hi>Iſaac</hi> and his Seed, had it not been more comprehenſive in the firſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulgation of it; and it is as if the Lord ſhould ſay, Though I have entred Covenant with thee, and thy Seed after thee, in their generations, for an everlaſting-Covenant, and have received and taken in thy whole Seed, as proceeding imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately from thine own loins, univerſally and
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:106624:43"/>indefinitely one as well as another, into a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant relation, together with thee with my ſelf, yet my meaning is, not that this Covenant-rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion between me and thy Seed, ſhall be continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in each of their reſpective lines, throughout their reſpective generations; but it is with <hi>Iſaac</hi> that I will eſtabliſh my Covenant, and with his Seed, as the perſon in whom, and in whoſe Seed, my Covenant ſhall take place, and be accompliſhed; though thy whole Seed be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended in the Promiſe, as the next and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Subjects of it, yet the Promiſe in the full latitude and extent of it, as it runs to Seed in their generations, for a Promiſe to continue ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſively throughout all generations, ſhall only take place and receive its full accompliſhment in <hi>Iſaac</hi> and his Line: But not to ſpend time upon this, that <hi>Iſaac</hi> was intended in this Promiſe is evident beyond all rational contradiction, and that is all at preſent I contend for.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> 2. Secondly, Others, and I ſuppoſe, vaſtly the major part of our oppoſers in the main truth pleaded for, conceive that it was <hi>Iſaac</hi> alone intended as the only Subject of that Promiſe, and conſequently that <hi>Iſhmael,</hi> and the other children of <hi>Abraham,</hi> were excluded from any right or title to it: And there are three Objections made againſt our extending that Promiſe, to the including and taking in <hi>Iſhmael,</hi> and the Sons of <hi>Abraham</hi> by <hi>Keturab,</hi> as the joynt Subjects with <hi>Iſaac</hi> of it.</p>
               <pb n="39" facs="tcp:106624:43"/>
               <p>Firſt, Say ſome, as God promiſed to be a God to <hi>Abraham</hi> and his Seed, ſo he promiſed the Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> for an everlaſting poſſeſſion to that Seed, to whom he promiſed to be a God; but the Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> was never given to, nor intended for, either <hi>Iſhmael,</hi> or any of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s other Children by <hi>Keturah,</hi> or any of their Seeds, and therefore certainly neither <hi>Iſhmael,</hi> nor any of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Seed by <hi>Keturah,</hi> could be intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in that Promiſe; for do we thine that God would promiſe that which he never intended to give? or ſhall we think that God would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe the Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> to all <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Seed, and yet never mind his promiſe after, nor regard to make good what he had promiſed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> To that I anſwer two things.</p>
               <p>Firſt, That, in that any of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Seed did not actually poſſeſs the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> nor in that God intended not that they ſhould poſſeſs it, it is no Argument they were not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended in, as the Subjects of, this grand Promiſe, wherein God ingaged to be a God to them in their generations: This is evident, becauſe ſome, who were undoubtedly the Subjects of this Promiſe, never did, nor was it intended by God, that they ſhould actually poſſeſs that Land; <hi>Abraham</hi> himſelf, who was the prime and principal party in this Covenant, according to the letter of it, and conſequently the undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Subject of this Promiſe, as referring to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, never had, nor was it intended by God, that he ſhould have the actual poſſeſſion of this
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:106624:44"/>Land; ſo for <hi>Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> Heirs with him of the ſame Promiſe, they never had, nor was it Gods intendment they ſhould have, the actual poſſeſſion of that Land. But</p>
               <p>Two things are replyed to this.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Though they did not poſſeſs it in their own perſons, yet in their poſterity they did; their poſterity had the actual poſſeſſion of it, and God gave it unto them only as a reverſion, to be poſſeſſed by their Children, when the ſin of the Inhabitants was full.</p>
               <p>To that I anſwer, It is certain all their poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity did not poſſeſs it, witneſs the whole race and poſterity of <hi>Iſaac</hi> deſcended by <hi>Eſan.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But you will ſay, Yet ſome of their poſterity did poſſeſs it, and that was enough to verifie the Promiſe unto them, conſidering under what no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion it was promiſed, <hi>viz.</hi> as afore expreſſed, a reverſion to be enjoyed by their poſterity.</p>
               <p>To that I anſwer, It is true, and ſo for what appears, the poſterity of any or of all of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>'s other Children, ſhould have had the joynt poſſeſſion with <hi>Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob</hi>'s poſterity, had not their Fathers forfeited their own and their poſterities right and title to the Promiſe, and their not inheriting, through an antecedent for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiture of the Promiſe, is no evidence that their firſt Parents, as immediately proceeding from <hi>Abraham,</hi> were not intended either in that
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:106624:44"/>or the former grand Promiſe of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.</p>
               <p>Secondly, It is replyed, that though <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob</hi> did not, nor was it intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by God, that they ſhould in their own per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, at that time, as then upon earth, enjoy the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> yet there is a time when they ſhall have the perſonal enjoyment of it, they ſhall ariſe again, and during the thouſand years reign of Chriſt upon earth, ſhall have the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe in the very letter made good unto them.</p>
               <p>To that I anſwer, Not to divert to debates excentrical to our preſent Queſtion, ſuppoſe that notion prove true, I would ſay the ſame of <hi>Iſhmael,</hi> and the other Children of <hi>Abrahame,</hi> both he and they, with their reſpective poſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, ſuppoſing their not being finally caſt out from the Covenant, and the Promiſes thereof, through their own or their Progenitors ſin, ſhall partake with <hi>Abraham, Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob</hi> in that their ſuppoſed felicity, and therefore neither their not actual poſſeſſing, nor Gods intention, that they ſhould not actually poſſeſs that Land, will prove, that they were not intended in that grand Promiſe, their caſe was no other than the caſe of ſeveral others, who were undoubtedly intended in that Promiſe.</p>
               <p>Secondly, I anſwer, That the Land of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan</hi> was either a meer temporal good, and the enjoyment of it only a temporal mercy, or elſe
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:106624:45"/>it was a type and pledge of a higher good, <hi>viz.</hi> of that City that hath foundations, whoſe Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker and Builder is God; and anſwerably taking it as a type, it was a ſpiritual good, and the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of it a ſpiritual bleſſing, and an eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial part of the Covenant of Grace, the Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> muſt be looked upon under the one or the other of theſe notions, or under both, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the letter under the former, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the myſtical or typical ſence under the latter. Now let our Oppoſites tell us, how or under what notions they look upon that Land, the ſubject matter of that Promiſe: if they ſay they look upon it under the firſt notion, namely, as a temporal good, and the Jews poſſeſſing of it only as a temporal bleſſing, then, I ſay, it was only an appendant, and not pertaining to the eſſence of the Covenant, and the promiſe of it only a definite promiſe, made to <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Seed, collectively or generally taken, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerably the Promiſe was verified in that any of his Seed, had the poſſeſſion of it: Indefinite promiſes, as made to any ſpecies or ſorts of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, collectively conſidered, are equivalent to particular promiſes, and they are verified, in caſe only ſome of that ſpecies, or ſort of perſons, have the good promiſed: That this promiſe of the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> ſuppoſing it to be only a temporal promiſe, is thus to be taken, is unque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtionable from the way and manner of Gods performing of it, had it been a promiſe to <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> and his Seed, diſtributively or particularly taken, it muſt have been made good to each par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:106624:45"/>Subject of the promiſe, both to <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> and all his Seed univerſally, which it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent it was not. If they ſay it was a ſpiritual promiſe, or the promiſe of a ſpiritual good, a higher and greater good typified by it: then I ſay, it was of the Eſſence of the Covenant, and was either in the letter, or in the ſpiritual ſence and meaning of it, performed both to <hi>Abraham</hi> and to all his Seed in their generations, whether <hi>Iſaac,</hi> or <hi>Iſhmael,</hi> or his Sons by <hi>Keturah,</hi> who did not through a failure in the performance of the condition of the Covenant, looſe their right and title to the promiſe of it; that is, though they had not the good promiſed it ſelf in the letter, yet they had the good typified by that Land, and principally intended in the Promiſe: A further proof of this I need not add than the Promiſe it ſelf conſidered, in conjunction with the faithfulneſs of God in the performance of his Promiſe.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, If they will ſay, they look upon it under both notions, which I conceive is moſt agreeable to the mind of God in that Promiſe; then I ſay as before, 'twas as a temporal promiſe, only an appendant to the Covenant, as a ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual promiſe of the Eſſence of it, and anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably was made and made good to <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Seed, both collectively and diſtributively taken, in the ſenſe afore opened; from all it evidently appears, that in that neither <hi>Iſhmael,</hi> nor the Sons of <hi>Keturah,</hi> did, nor was it intended by God, that they ſhould enjoy the Land of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan,</hi>
                  <pb n="44" facs="tcp:106624:46"/>it will not follow, that they were not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended in that grand Promiſe, wherein God ingageth himſelf, to be a God to <hi>Abraham</hi> and his Seed in their generations, they might be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended in that Promiſe, and yet not actually enjoy that Land promiſed, as many others, who were undoubtedly intended in the former Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, yet never actually in the letter enjoyed the good of that Promiſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> 2. Say others, If <hi>Iſhmael</hi> were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended in this Promiſe, and received as one of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Seed into his Covenant, why doth <hi>Abraham</hi> pray ſo earneſtly for him, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.18? Doth not his praying ſo earneſtly for him, at leaſt, ſtrongly intimate, he had no right to, or intereſt in the Covenant afore eſtabliſhed with <hi>Abraham,</hi> with reference to his Seed? If <hi>Iſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mael</hi> was under the promiſe of having God a God to him, what need <hi>Abraham</hi> pray ſo earn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtly that he might live before God?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> I anſwer, May not a promiſed good be prayed for? Or may not a father pray that his child may live, grow up, and enjoy the good of promiſes relating to this life, and give com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable diſcoveries of his intereſt in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of the Covenant? Who can queſtion, but that he may? But the true reaſon of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>'s prayer for <hi>Iſhmael,</hi> was an intimation given by God, in thoſe promiſes made with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to that child to be born of <hi>Sarah,</hi> of what is more plainly after expreſſed, that he
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:106624:46"/>ſhould be the ſpecial Child, in whom, and in whoſe line the Seed ſhould be called, that it with whom and with whoſe Seed the Covenant ſhould be eſtabliſhed, according to the full ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent and latitude of the promiſes of it, but this is no intimation at all, much leſs a concluſive Argument, that <hi>Iſhmael</hi> was not at preſent taken into Covenant, and intended in the Promiſes of it, as one of the immediate Subjects there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> 3. And that which by moſt of our Oppoſites is eſpecially inſiſted upon, is a ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed inconſiſtency between what is affirmed in this our firſt Propoſition, <hi>viz.</hi> That God in this grand Promiſe of the Covenant intended all <hi>Abraham</hi>'s natural Seed univerſally and indefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely, one as well as another, as the next and immediate Subjects of it, conſidering what the ſacred Story relates of <hi>Iſhmael</hi> in particular, one of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Seed, affirmed by us to be intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in that Promiſe, and other Principles and Aſſertions conſtantly maintained by us, who ground the infant-ſeed of believing parents right to and intereſt in the Covenant, upon this its firſt eſtabliſhment with <hi>Abraham</hi> and his Seed in their Generations; theſe Principles and Aſſertions, with which what is affirmed of all <hi>Abraham</hi>'s natural Seed, and of <hi>Iſhmael</hi> in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, is ſuppoſed to be inconſiſtent, are more eſpecially theſe two.</p>
               <p>Firſt, That that Covenant, now eſtabliſhed
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:106624:47"/>with <hi>Abraham,</hi> was a Covenant of Grace, and the very ſame for ſubſtance with that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der which Believers are under the Goſpel ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration.</p>
               <p>Secondly, That the Covenant of Grace is an immutable and unchangeable Covenant, a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant that cannot be broken, a Covenant from a ſtanding in which none can fall. Now it is objected, That if it be true as we affirm, that this Covenant, now eſtabliſhed with <hi>Abraham</hi> and his Seed, was the Covenant of Grace, and that <hi>Iſhmael</hi> in particular was intended in this Promiſe, and anſwerably taken into this Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with <hi>Abraham,</hi> as one of his Seed there in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, then the Covenant of Grace muſt be granted to be a mutable and changeable Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, a Covenant that may be broken, contrary to our other principles, ſeeing it is evident, and granted by us, that in caſe <hi>Iſhmael</hi> was ever in this Covenant, he did break it, and was caſt out of it, and was diſinherited of the promiſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in it; and if ſo, then it will follow, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to what we elſewhere affirm, that a man may be in the Covenant of Grace to day, and caſt out to morrow, and then may be in again within a few dayes after, and yet caſt out again, and in the cloſe finally periſh. Now it is ſaid, How can Principles or Aſſertions, lying in ſuch a diametrical oppoſition one to another, be all true? Therefore ſure we muſt either grant, that <hi>Iſhmael</hi> was not intended in this Promiſe, and conſequently not one of this Seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi>
                  <pb n="47" facs="tcp:106624:47"/>with whom, in conjunction with <hi>Abraham</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, God never entred Covenant, noiſe that Covenant was not the Covenant of Grace, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der which Believers now are, or elſe that the Covenant of Grace is mutable, and may be bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken; that perſons may be in it, and after caſt out and diſpoſſeſſed of that good they had ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times a Covenant-right and title to.</p>
               <p>Before I return a direct Anſwer to this Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, I ſhall premiſe, that this Objection is urged by our Oppoſites to a twofold end or purpoſe.</p>
               <p>Firſt, It is urged by ſome, to diſprove or overthrow what we affirm of this Covenant, now eſtabliſhed with <hi>Abraham</hi> and his Seed, <hi>viz.</hi> That it is the Covenant of Grace, the ſame for ſubſtance that Believers in Goſpel times are under. Say they, This Covenant made with <hi>Abraham,</hi> and his natural Seed, might be bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, but the Covenant of Grace cannot be bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken; one might be in that Covenant to day, and caſt out to morrow; witneſs <hi>Iſhmael,</hi> who though taken into Covenant, yet was ſoon caſt out again; but it is otherwiſe with the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace, and the perſons admitted into it, that is, a Covenant that cannot be broken, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons once, in that Covenant are never caſt out again; and therefore this could not be a Covenant of Grace, but a legal Covenant, as ſome call it, a temporal Covenant, as others.</p>
               <pb n="48" facs="tcp:106624:48"/>
               <p>Secondly, It is urged by others, in a way of oppoſition to what is affirmed concerning <hi>Iſhmael</hi>'s being intended in this Promiſe, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently received into Covenant with <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham:</hi> Theſe grant that this was a Covenant of Grace, and hold with us, that the Covenant of Grace of Grace is a Covenant that cannot be broken. Now ſay they, it is ridiculous to affirm, that <hi>Iſhmael</hi> was in this Covenant, ſeeing it is certain he never enjoyed the good promiſed, which he ſhould undoubtedly have done, had he been taken in as a party in it. The Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace, ſay they, infallibly ſecutes the good promiſed in it to all that have admiſſion in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it, it is a Covenant that is immutable, thoſe that are once in it are never caſt out, but ſhall infallibly enjoy the good promiſed: but <hi>Iſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mael</hi> enjoyed not the good promiſed in this Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant; therefore it is ridiculous to ſay, he was ever taken into it. So that we may ſee our Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſites are not agreed among themſelves, ſome granting that <hi>Iſhmael</hi> was intended in that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, and conſequently that he was a party in that Covenant, but deny that that Covenant was a Covenant of Grace: Others granting, that that was a Covenant of Grace, but deny <hi>Iſhmael</hi> to be a party in it, whence it appears, that in all theſe three Aſſertions, <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>Iſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mael</hi> was intended in that Promiſe, that the Covenant, in which the Promiſe is contained, is a Covenant of Grace. That the Covenant of Grace cannot be broken, we have the ſuffrage of ſome of our Oppoſites, as they are taken ſeverally.</p>
               <pb n="49" facs="tcp:106624:48"/>
               <p>But you will ſay, They all agree, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap> be all true taken conjunctively: It is t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap> they do ſo; and where their miſtake lies, either as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> what we affirm, or as to the truth it ſelf, ſhall be now conſidered.</p>
               <p>Firſt, And I ſhall firſt ſhew in what ſence we hold and maintain the Covenant of Grace, to be an immutable and unchangeable Covenant, a Covenant that cannot be broken.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Lay down ſome Propoſitions for the vindicating the truth aſſerted in this firſt Propoſition, for carrying any appearance of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnancy to that Principle held and maintained by us, in the ſence it is held and maintained by us, concerning the immutability of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace.</p>
               <p>For the firſt: and thus we muſt obſerve a twofold diſtinction.</p>
               <p>Firſt, We muſt diſtinguiſh between an exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal and viſible, and an internal and inviſible be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in Covenant, or between the Covenant of Grace, as externally and viſibly, and as internal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and inviſibly plighted, or mutually entred be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and men; that there is an external and viſible being in Covenant, or that there is an external and viſible plighting, or mutual entring of Covenant between God and men, where yet there is not an internal and inviſible being in Covenant, nor any internal mutual en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:106624:49"/>Covenant between God and men, is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent through the whole Scripture and is ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtratively proved by others, eſpecially Mr. <hi>Cobbett</hi> of <hi>New-England,</hi> that it is wholly ſuperfluous to add any thing, I ſhall therefore only ſay, that unleſs we do grant this diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, we muſt hold, that either Chriſt hath no viſible Body, Church, or People in the World, or elſe that ſome may be of the viſible. Body, Church or People of Chriſt, who yet are not in any ſence in the Covenant of Grace; the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ſure none will affirm, and the granting the latter will grant what I contend for, as will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in the proceſs of our diſcourſe.</p>
               <p>Secondly, We muſt diſtinguiſh between being in Covenant, through a perſonal acceptation of the terms of the Covenant, and ingaging with God in a Covenant way, and being in Covenant, by vertue of the gratious tenour of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant it ſelf, as made with <hi>Abraham</hi> and his Seed in their generations; that there is a being in Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant by a perſonal acceptation of the terms of the Covenant, and ingaging with God in a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant way, will be denied by none; and that there is a being in Covenant, or being under the promiſes of the Covenant, by vertue of the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious tenour of the Covenant it ſelf, will I hope ſufficiently appear from the proof of this and our next Propoſition. Now when we ſay, the Covenant of Grace is an immutable and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable Covenant, a Covenant that cannot be broken, we intend it of the Covenant as per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonally,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:106624:49"/>and that intnely and ſincerely entred by a truly regenerate Soul, and not of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant as only externally and unſincerely entred by Hypocrites, nor of the Covenant as made with believing Parents, with reference to their natural Seed; and the meaning of what is af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed concerning the immutability and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeableneſs of the Covenant of Grace is only this, that when once a Soul is ſavingly wrought upon, to a rightly cloſing in with Chriſt, and a ſaving cloſing with the terms of the Covenant, that Soul ſhall never totally and finally fall away, ſo as to ſuffer an abſolute and total loſs of that Grace wrought in it, nor be abſolutely caſt out of a Covenant ſtate and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation God-ward: whether theſe promiſes, upon the warrant of which this immutability and unchangeableneſs of the Covenant is afferted and maintained, will prove any more, ſhall be conſidered, at leaſt ſo far as concerns my preſent purpoſe, by and by. Having then given the ſence, in which we hold the Covenant of Grace to be immutable and unchangeable, I proceed to the ſecond thing promiſed, the Propoſitions, and they are theſe.</p>
               <p>Firſt, That this Covenant now eſtabliſhed between God and <hi>Abraham,</hi> and his Seed in their generations, which I grant, yea affirm, that it was a Covenant of Grace, the ſame in ſubſtance that Believers are ſtill under, was and ſtill is a conditional Covenant: Let not that term <hi>conditional</hi> offend, I intend no more than
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:106624:50"/>what I ſuppoſe will on all hands be granted, <hi>viz.</hi> That as God promiſed good to <hi>Abraham,</hi> with reference both to himſelf and his Seed in their generations, ſo he required the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of duty as from <hi>Abraham</hi> himſelf, ſo from his Seed in their reſpective generations: In brief thus, this Covenant contained promiſes of good from God, yet with a reſtipulation of duty from the parties with whom it was made, and unto whom the promiſes did appertain, and this is eſſential to the very being of a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant as properly taken: It is true, this term Covenant is variouſly uſed in Scripture, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times for a bare promiſe on Gods part, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times for the reſtipulation on mans part, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times for the token of the Covenant, but theſe are improper ſignifications of the word; when it is properly taken, it alwayes ſignifies a mutual compact between God and man, wherein God ingageth himſelf by promiſe to them, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gageth them to the performance of what him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf hath conſtituted to be their duty: a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant in general when properly taken, and conſequently this Covenant in particular, which muſt partake of the general nature of Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants, every Species muſt partake of its Genus, being <hi>quiddam: complexum,</hi> implying two or more parties covenanting, ſo two parties co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venanted, the giving of ſome good on the one part, and the return of ſome performance on the other, and that as indiſpenſably neceſſary to the preſervation of the Covenant inviolate on each part.</p>
               <pb n="53" facs="tcp:106624:50"/>
               <p>Secondly, That this reſtipulation or conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on on <hi>Abraham</hi>'s part, did concern him, both as a ſingle perſon, and as a Parent, ſtanding in a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rental relation towards his Seed, taken in as joynt parties with himſelf into covenant, my meaning is evident, <hi>Abraham</hi> ſtood in a double capacity, as a ſingle party, with whom God entred covenant, and as a father of children, to whom the promiſes of the Covenant did in common with himſelf appertain. Now as <hi>Abraham,</hi> as a ſingle perſon in covenant, was to accept of, and perform the conditions of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, he was in that capacity ingaged to by God, ſo as a parent he had ſomething of duty incumbent upon him, with reference to his Seed, as immediately deſcending from his own loins, and as his faithful performance of that duty in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbent upon him in his ſingle capacity, ſo his performing that duty incumbent upon him as a parent, in reference to his Seed, was abſolutely neceſſary in order to his enjoying the good pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed, with reference both to himſelf and his Seed: The truth of this Propoſition is evident from theſe two places of Scripture, compared together, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.1. and <hi>Gen.</hi> 18.19. <hi>Walk before me, and be thou perfect,</hi> There was <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>'s duty, in reference to himſelf as a ſingle perſon, with whom the Covenant was entred; <hi>For I know him, that he will command his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and his Houſhold after him, and they ſhall keep judgment and juſtice, that the Lord may bring upon</hi> Abraham <hi>that which he hath ſpoken of him;</hi> that is, that he may be a God to him,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:106624:51"/>and his Seed after him: There was <hi>Abraham</hi>'s duty, as a Parent and Maſter of a Family, and under this term <hi>Command</hi> all other duties, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving or referring to their walking in the way of the Lord, were implyed and comprehended. Now ſaith the Lord, <hi>Abraham will thus command his Children and Houſhold, that the Lord may bring upon him what he hath ſpoken of him:</hi> Whence it appears, that <hi>Abraham</hi>'s performance of his duty towards his Children and Houſhold, was a neceſſary condition of Gods bringing up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, or making good to him, what he had promiſed, in reference to his Children and Houſhold, and that without the performance of that duty he could not expect, according to the true intent and meaning of the Promiſe, that God ſhould bring that good upon him, or do that good to him: and what is ſaid of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> is true of all his Seed, ſuppoſing them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that double capacity: <hi>Abraham</hi> was to be a pattern to all his Seed, both in priviledges and in duties.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, That whatever was the condition or reſtipulation of the Covenant as made with <hi>Abraham,</hi> was the condition or reſtipulation required of his natural Seed, and to be actually performed by them in their own perſons, ſo ſoon as they came to that maturity of age, as rendred them capable thereof, and that as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpenſably neceſſary to the compleating and continuance of their covenant relation with God, into which they, as <hi>Abraham</hi>'s natural
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:106624:51"/>Seed, were admitted in their infancy; though God was pleaſed to enter covenant, not only with <hi>Abraham</hi> himſelf, but with his Seed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with him, and his accepting of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant for himſelf and them, conſtituted a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant relation between God and <hi>Abraham,</hi> and his Seed; and that covenant-relation was continued during his Seeds infant capacity upon <hi>Abraham</hi>'s account, yet when they grew up to a capacity of a perſonal ingaging with God in a Covenant way, and performing the reſtipulation required. Now the continuance of that co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant-relation between God and them, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpenſably required their perſonal accepting of, and performing that reſtipulation or condition, that <hi>Abraham</hi> in their infancy had accepted for them, and their non-acceptance or non-perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of that condition did, <hi>ipſo facto,</hi> diſanul the Covenant, or forfeit their right to, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in it and the promiſes of it, God ſtood the longer by vertue of that Promiſe obliged to be a God unto them; and for them to have ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the continuance of that covenant-relation between God and them, into which they were afore admitted, and upon that account expected the good promiſed; without their perſonal per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of the duty the Covenant did oblige them to, had been a groundleſs preſumption, The truth of this Propoſition is evident in part from what hath been already ſaid, and will more fully appear, when I come to the proof of my ſecond Propoſition. <hi>Abraham</hi>'s commanding his Children and Houſhold to keep the way of
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:106624:52"/>the Lord, in order to that end, namely, their enjoying the good promiſed neceſſarily ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth it; for why ſhould he command them to keep the way of the Lord, in relation to ſuch an end, if their keeping that way had no neceſſary reference to that end, but the end had been at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained without their keeping that way; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, were not this true, there could have been no ſuch thing, as breach of covenant, found among any of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s natural Seed, as will be obvious to every ordinary capacity. Before I proceed further, let me note by the way, that this Covenant, now eſtabliſhed with <hi>Abraham,</hi> and his Seed in their generations, implyed a twofold condition, neceſſary to be obſerved in order to Gods making good the promiſes of it, referring to his Seed.</p>
               <p>Firſt, There was a condition incumbent on <hi>Abraham</hi> himſelf, there was ſomething of duty required of him, with reference to his Seed, <hi>viz.</hi> that he command them to keep the way of the Lord, as is obſerved in the foregoing Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition.</p>
               <p>Secondly, There was a condition incumbent upon the Seed, as grown up and become capable of underſtanding and performing it, that is, That they walk in the way of the Lord; and ſuppoſing that either <hi>Abraham</hi> had failed in his duty, or his Seed in theirs, God had been acquitted of any charge of unfaithfulneſs to his promiſe, though the good promiſed, with refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:106624:52"/>to his Seed, had never been given in; God promiſeth to be a God to <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Seed, as well as to himſelf, yet with this condition, that he inſtruct and command his Seed, and that they accept of, and perform the duty ingaged to by covenant.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, That <hi>Iſhmael</hi>'s breach of cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant did neither proceed from a failure on Gods part, in making good the Promiſes made to him, nor conſiſt in his own looſing or falling from in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent Grace, but did wholly lye in his non per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of that duty required, as indiſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſably neceſſary to the compleating and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance of that Covenant-relation he was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted into with God, and tranſgreſſing thoſe Commands he was obliged to the obſervation of; in brief, he fell from a Covenant-ſtate, but not from Covenanted-grace, for that he never had an actual poſſeſſion of; ſo that to affirm, that <hi>Iſhmael</hi> was in the Covenant, now eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed with <hi>Abraham</hi> and his Seed, and that that Covenant was the Covenant of Grace that Believers are ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ill under, notwithſtanding his breach of Covenant in the ſence now opened, is no way inconſiſtent with what is affirmed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the immutability of the Covenant of Grace, we freely grant, and our Oppoſites muſt grant it too, unleſs they will admit of the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdities aforementioned verſe 12. that perſons may be in an external Covenant ſtate God ward, and yet want the truth of Grace, may looſe a Covenant-ſtate, though not looſe Covenanted-Grace,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:106624:53"/>or fall from a ſtate of Grace. But not to leave any doubt, that may a riſe in the minds of any, about what hath been ſaid, unſatisfied, I am aware of one Objection, and that not without a ſeeming weight and ſtrength in it, will be made againſt what hath been ſaid, and that is this.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> It will be ſaid, Doth not the Scripture plainly intimate, it not poſitively offer <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, That the Covenant of Grace cannot be broken, no not in the ſence in which it is now ſuppoſed <hi>Iſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mael</hi> did break it, and is not that at leaſt one Characteriſtical difference between the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace and the firſt Covenant, and the peculiar excellency, in reſpect of which the Covenant of Grace doth excel that former Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant? Hath not God promiſed to write his Law in the inward parts, and put his fear in the hearts of all that have admiſſion into this Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, as the means to prevent their breach of it? Now it will be ſaid, How could <hi>Iſhmael,</hi> or any Child of believing Parents, ſuppoſing he was and they are in the Covenant of Grace, ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>il in performing the conditions of that Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, unleſs God ſhould fail in making good theſe Promiſes, which to affirm would be blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy, and therefore ſure, had he been and were they in the Covenant of Grace, he never had, not they never would break Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, through a failing in performing the conditions of it.</p>
               <pb n="59" facs="tcp:106624:53"/>
               <p>Now to this I anſwer, That take theſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes as indefinitely laid down, ſo they are only made to the Church indefinitely as a collective body, and indefinite Promiſes, as ſo made, do not infallibly ſecure the good promiſed to every individual perſon externally intereſſed in them.</p>
               <p>But you will ſay, Suppoſe the truth of this firſt Propoſition, <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>Abraham</hi>'s natural Seed, immediately proceeding from his own loins, were to be looked upon as the Subjects of this Promiſe, diſtributively taken then every one in particular had a real and actual intereſt in it.</p>
               <p>To that I anſwer, It is true: but conſider what hath been already ſaid; the Covenant and Promiſes of it were conditional, and his not performing the conditions forfeited the good promiſed.</p>
               <p>But you will further ſay, Are not theſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, of writing the Law in the inward parts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> included in that grand Promiſe, wherein God promiſeth to be a God to him and them, and conſequently their performance of the condition was virtually included and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed in the Promiſe it ſelf, and ſo the Promiſe did ſecure their performance of the condition; though the Covenant of Grace hath conditions, yet they are <hi>Couditiones conditionatae,</hi> conditions which are themſelves promiſed in the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant; hence though the Covenant be not ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely unconditional, yet it is equivalent there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, in as much as the conditions are them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:106624:54"/>included in the Promiſes of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant; and therefore ſure if they had been actually under Covenant, their performance of the conditions had been ſecured by this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe.</p>
               <p>To this I anſwer two things, That though theſe Promiſes do hold forth the main and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple conditions of the Covenant, as Regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Faith, Repentance, and the like, and they ſhould be included in this Promiſe, of Gods being a God to his people, and though they run in the external tenour of them abſolutely, yet they are not abſolutely abſolute, as I may ſo ſpeak; they have a ſubordinate condition, and that is, that the parties concerned in them do faithfully uſe the means appointed of God, in a ſubſerviency to his working in or beſtowing upon them the good promiſed; this is evident from <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.37. where we have the very ſame good, though in other terms or phraſes, promiſed; ſo alſo in <hi>Prov.</hi> 2.6. theſe Promiſes hold forth what we of our ſelves cannot attain to or perform; but they ſuppoſe, and require our uſe of means, which, as Mr. <hi>Feuner</hi> excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently expreſſeth it, lye between our can and our cannot, and though it is true, a man, while in his natural eſtate, cannot uſe the means ſo, as ſhall infallibly ſecure the good promiſed to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, yet his not uſing of them according to what, through the improvement of what ability, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther natural or ſpiritual, he hath received, he might do, will acquit God from unfaithfulneſs in denying the good promiſed.</p>
               <pb n="61" facs="tcp:106624:54"/>
               <p>But ſecondly, I anſwer, That take the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant as externally made and declared to <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> and his Seed in their generations, as im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying a ſtipulation on Gods part, and a reſtipu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation on mans part, ſo theſe Promiſes of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine teachings, writing the Law in the heart, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are not included as eſſential to this Promiſe, of Gods being a God to them, but are diſtinct Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, made indefinitely, to the Covenant-people of God; in making good of which, God acts according to his Soveraign will and pleaſure, in a complyance with his eternal Decrees and Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes of election and preterition, and anſwerab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, no individual perſon can lay an actual claim to them, afore they are at leaſt initially or incho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atively fulfilled; Gods being a God to any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual perſon, doth require and preſuppoſe, that they do for the preſent, ſuppoſing them capable, or for the furture, as ſoon as capable, take God in Chriſt as their God, which that his Elect ſhall do, is ſecured by theſe Promiſes; but that every individual perſon externally in Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, and under the Promiſes thereof ſhall do, is not ſecured by them. If any ſhall affirm, that theſe Promiſes are included, as an eſſential part of the good of that grand Promiſe of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, it concerns them to make good what they affirm, and ſhew how the very ſame Promiſe, at leaſt for the ſubſtance of it, was made good to the ſeed of the Jews, and how it came to paſs, notwithſtanding that Promiſe, that they never had their hearts truly circumciſed to love the Lord with all their hearts, and all their ſouls,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:106624:55"/>as the letter of that Promiſe, <hi>Deut.</hi> 30.6. af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms they ſhould. Beſides, let it is be further noted, that the Covenants-relation ſtabliſhed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and the ſeed of believing Parents, meetly by vertue of the external tenour of the Covenant, is not ſo full and compleat as that is, which is conſtituted through a Souls perſonal acceptation of the Covenant, and actual inga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging with God in a Covenant way; the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant in a proper and full ſence muſt be mutual; but ſo it is not in the caſe of the Infant-ſeed of believing parents, their being in covenant is rather a being under a conditional Promiſe of the good contained in the Covenant, than being properly and compleatly in covenant with God, though in a ſence God may, as he is in Scripture ſaid to enter covenant with them, he enters covenant as he makes promiſe of the good of the Covenant to them, which yet he doth, as I have ſaid, only conditionally, and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleating of the Covenant-relation between God and them, depends upon their perſonal ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance of the terms propoſed in it, when they come to ripeneſs of years.</p>
               <p>To put a cloſe to this firſt ſubordinate Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, by what hath been ſaid, <hi>I</hi> ſuppoſe, the truth aſſerted in it is ſufficiently evident, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding what may be objected in a way of oppoſition to it; and I have inſiſted the longer upon this, becauſe it is the foundation to our whole Structure to be raiſed, in reference to the confirmation of the truth pleaded for, and the full evidencing of this, will make out way plain
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:106624:55"/>to the following Propoſitions, in as much as <hi>Abraham,</hi> being the firſt perſon with whom the Covenant was, at leaſt in ſuch a latitude, formal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and expreſly entred, he muſt needs be the rule, meaſure or pattern, according to which the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, in all following Ages, ſhould be entred and continued between God and his Seed. <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum in unoque que genere eſt regula a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">

               <argument>
                  <p>The ſecond ſubordinate Propoſition laid down. How to be underſtood, declared. The firſt way of its confirmation, <hi>viz.</hi> the tenour of the Promiſe, as at firſt made to <hi>Abraham,</hi> propoſed and proſecuted. Objections anſwered.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Second Propoſition. THat the ſame Promiſe that God made unto</hi> Abraham, <hi>with reference to himſelf and his natural Seed, is by God himſelf, and that in the ſame latitude and extent given to, and ſeiled upon believing Gentiles: The Promiſe runs in the Jame tenour, both in regard of extent and limitations, to</hi> Abrahams <hi>Seed, whether natural or myſtical, that it ran in to</hi> Abraham <hi>himſelf; it is continued to the Seed, as it was firſt eſtabliſhed with their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Only for the preventing miſtakes let it be noted, That</hi> Abraham <hi>had ſome preheminency above any of his Seed, as it was meet the Father ſhould have ſomething of preheminency above his Children.</hi> Abraham <hi>had a twofold prehemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency.</hi>
                  </p>
               </argument>
               <pb n="65" facs="tcp:106624:56"/>
               <p>Firſt, He had a preheminence in point of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity or fatherhood; he was not only a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Father of natural Children, as any of his Seed may be; but he was, conſtituted a myſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Father, to all that ſhould in after ages be admitted into the ſame Covenant with himſelf, whether Jews or Gentiles, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.11.</p>
               <p>Secondly, He had a preheminency in regard of his natural Seed, Race or Poſterity. He had a threefold preheminency in regard of his natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Seed.</p>
               <p>Firſt, In their multiplication. God never multiplied the Seed of any Believer as he mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplied the natural Seed of <hi>Abraham.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, In their ſegregation or ſeparation from other people, and their incorporation to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether as one Nation, Body politick, or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, In Gods ſingling them out as the ſpecial Subjects of his Kingdom, and vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafing unto them his Covenant, with the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits, priviledges, and bleſſings thereof, in ſo ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral and extenſive a way, as he hath done, and will yet do. His Church or ſpiritual Kingdom, under the firſt Teſtament, conſiſted in a ſpecial manner of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s natural Race or Poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and he will again take his natural Poſterity, as the people who in a ſpecial manner ſhall
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:106624:57"/>injoy the good things of the Covenant of Grace, as yet to be adminiſtred in the world: This twofold preheminency we grant that <hi>Abraham</hi> had above any of his Seed, whether natural or myſtical: But yet take <hi>Abraham</hi> as a natural Father, accepting of the Covenant God made with him, and ſo the ſame Promiſe, that was given unto him, is given and ſetled upon his whole Seed, and conſequently (which only falls un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der our preſent conſideration) is given to, and ſetled upon believing Gentiles. The truth of this Propoſition I ſhall (the Lord aſſiſting) evidence four wayes.</p>
               <p>Firſt, From the tenour of the Promiſe made to <hi>Abraham,</hi> with reference to his Seed, at the firſt eſtabliſhment of the Covenant between God and him; and here we muſt have recourſe to what hath been already ſaid, for the explication of this Promiſe. The ſum of all is this; That when God promiſed <hi>Abraham</hi> to be a God to him, and his Seed in their generations, his mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing was, that he would be a God both to <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> and his whole Seed, as before explained in their reſpective generations; that is, to them and their reſpective Children, deſcending im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately from their own loins; yet ſo, as that their intereſt in the Promiſe, and enjoyment of the good promiſed, ſhould be continued and vouchſafed to them upon condition of their walking in the ſteps of the faith and obedience of their Father <hi>Abraham;</hi> and conſequently, that the Promiſe did not actually appertain ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:106624:57"/>to any of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s natural Race or Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity, beyond his Children immediately de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcending from him, or to any of his Seeds, Races, or Poſterities, beyond their immediate Children, included with them in that phraſe, <hi>their Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations,</hi> by vertue of that their remote relation unto them. Now then all that I have to do for the proving the ſettlement of this Promiſe, in the ſame extent and latitude upon believing Gentiles, in which it was given to <hi>Abraham</hi> himſelf, by the tenour of the Promiſes as now made to <hi>Abraham,</hi> is to prove, that this is the true ſence and meaning of this Promiſe, as made to him with reference to his natural Seed, for look as the Promiſe was to be underſtood as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring to his natural Seed, ſo it is to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood as referring to his myſtical Seed, in as much as both are equally and alike intended in the Promiſe, as at firſt made unto <hi>Abraham,</hi> both his natural and myſtical Seed ſtanding in one and the ſame capacity reſpective to the Promiſe, and therefore as it ought to be interpreted as it had reference to the one, ſo it ought to be inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted as referring to the other. Now that this Promiſe, as referring to <hi>Abraham</hi>'s natural Seed, was to be interpreted and underſtood in the extent and latitude, and yet with the limitations before expreſſed, I ſhall make good by theſe two or three Arguments.</p>
               <p>Firſt, That muſt needs be the true ſence and meaning of this Promiſe, which alone is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with the truth and faithfulneſs of God
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:106624:58"/>in performing it: But that ſence and meaning, which is given according to the extent and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitations afore expreſſed, is only conſiſtent with the truth and faithfulneſs of God in performing it: Therefore that ſence and meaning muſt be the alone true and genuine ſence and meaning of it, and anſwerably is ſo to be interpreted and underſtood by us. That we ought to interpret and underſtand the Promiſes of God in ſuch a ſence and meaning, as is conſiſtent with his truth and faithfulneſs in performing them, and when there is but one ſence and meaning conſiſtent with the truth and faithfulneſs of God, that that muſt be the alone true ſence and meaning, ſure none will deny. God is a true and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful God, a God that cannot lye, not only will not, but cannot lye; therefore that ſence and meaning put upon his Promiſes, which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with his truth and faithfulneſs in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming them, cannot poſſibly be the true ſence and meaning of them. Now that the ſence and meaning put upon this Promiſe, according to the extent and latitude, and with the limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations before expreſſed, is alone conſiſtent with the truth and faithfulneſs of God in performing it, will be evident, by ſhewing the inconſiſtency of any other ſence and meaning poſſibly to be put upon it, with the truth and faithfulneſs of God in performing it. And for this let us a little inquire what other ſence and meaning can poſſibly be put upon this Promiſe, and I ſuppoſe the only ſence and meaning that will be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted to be put upon it, will be this, <hi>viz.</hi>
                  <pb n="69" facs="tcp:106624:58"/>That when God promiſed to <hi>Abraham,</hi> with reference to his Seed, to be a God unto them in their generations, his meaning was only this, That he would be a God to each of them in their reſpective ages or generations wherein they ſhould live; and ſo by this phraſe, <hi>In their generations,</hi> we are to underſtand only each par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular or individual perſon of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Seed, as ſubſiſting in their reſpective ages or genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and not as including Parents and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</p>
               <p>Now let us a little purſue this ſence and meaning, and ſee whether it be conſiſtent with the truth and faithfulneſs of God in his Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. And here let it be remembred, that <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>'s natural Seed muſt neceſſarily be primarily intended in this Promiſe, as the firſt and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Subjects of it; this hath been already proved, and therefore I ſhall take it for granted at preſent. And it muſt further be conſidered, that though <hi>Abraham</hi>'s natural Seed, as imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately deſcending from his own loins, were firſtly intended, as the primary Subjects of this Promiſe; yet it had a further reſpect, <hi>viz.</hi> to his whole natural Race and Poſterity, as me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately deſcending from him, in ſucceeding ages; this is evident, as from other Scriptures, ſo from this very phraſe, <hi>their generations;</hi> and beſides, the whole Context evidently declares it. In <hi>Gen.</hi> 15.16. it evidently appears, that God intended not, that <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Seed ſhould poſſeſs the Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> till the fourth gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration; yet it is promiſed to the Seed intended
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:106624:59"/>in this Promiſe, that they ſhould have the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and that for an everlaſting poſſeſſion: So that when God promiſed to be a God to <hi>Abraham</hi> and his Seed, though he intended his own immediate Children, yet he had a further reſpect to his natural Race and Poſterity, as me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately deſcending from him.</p>
               <p>Now let it be conſidered, how it was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with the truth and faithfulneſs of God in his Promiſes, to promiſe to <hi>Abraham,</hi> to be a God to him, and his Seed, both immediately and mediately deſcending from him, ſeeing it is certain he was not a God to all his Seed, no not ſo much as in an external and outward way; for when <hi>Iſhmael</hi> was caſt out of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, and together therewith, or thereby, out of the Covenant, God ceaſed to be a God to any of his Race or Poſterity, unleſs by their perſonal acceptation of the Covenant, they became again incorporated into the Church of the Jews, as any other Heathen might be: and the like is true of <hi>Eſau</hi>'s Race and Poſterity; ſo for the whole body of the Jewiſh Nation at this day, there is a ceſſation of any actual Covenant-rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion between God and them Now how could God caſt off ſo great a part of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Seed from being his people, and how could he ceaſe to be a God to them, and yet remain faithful to his Promiſe, in caſe this be the ſence and mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it? Yes, it may be ſome will ſay, the truth and faithfulneſs of God may be vindicated two wayes.</p>
               <pb n="71" facs="tcp:106624:59"/>
               <p>Firſt, It may be vindicated by the conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the nature of this Promiſe: It was, as you your ſelves grant, an indefinite Promiſe made to <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Seed collectively taken, and ſo was verified, in the performance of it to ſome of his Seed, though it was not performed uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally to every individual perſon of his Seed.</p>
               <p>But to this I reply two things.</p>
               <p>Firſt, That this Promiſe, according to the ſence and meaning contended for by my Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers, cannot be an indefinite Promiſe to <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>'s Seed, collectively taken, but muſt needs be a definite Promiſe to his Seed, diſtributively taken; for that is the ſenſe and meaning con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended for, That God promiſed to be a God to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and each of his Seed in their reſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive ages or generations. Now, according to this ſence, this term <hi>Seed,</hi> muſt needs be taken diſtributively, as meant of every one of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>'s Seed: So that whenever, in any genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>Abraham</hi> had one born unto him, as one of his Seed, the Promiſe did reach and take in him, or her, as ſo born unto him, as one of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects intended in it. If it had been only ſaid to <hi>Abraham,</hi> to thee and to thy Seed, it might have been an indefinite Promiſe to his Seed, colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctively taken; but when 'tis added, in their generations, according to this ſence it muſt needs be a definite Promiſe made to his Seed, diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butively or ſingularly taken; and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, Gods not being a God unto any
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:106624:60"/>of his Seed, had been a breach of this Promiſe, as made unto <hi>Abraham,</hi> with reference to his Seed.</p>
               <p>Secondly, I anſwer, Though the Promiſe were an indefinite Promiſe made to <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Seed, collectively taken, yet none ever did, or ever ſhould fail of enjoying the good promiſed, ſuppoſing there had been no failure in perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the condition of it, either by the parties themſelves, or by their next or remote Progeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors.</p>
               <p>Secondly, It may be it will be ſaid, The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe was made conditionally, and <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Seed failing in the performance of the conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, diſobliged God from making good the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe to them.</p>
               <p>To that I reply, That it is readily granted, that this Covenant, and the Promiſes thereof, was made to <hi>Abraham</hi> and his Seed conditio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally: But obſerve it; according to the ſence and meaning pleaded for by our Oppoſers, every Child of any Jew, or of any of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity, muſt be in the eye of this Promiſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted as one of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Seed, and as ſo related unto him, be intended in it as one of the Subjects of it; And how can a Child forfeit its right to a Promiſe before it is born? So that ſuppoſe that the immediate Father had failed in the condition of the Promiſe, and thereby de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived himſelf of an intereſt in it, yet he could
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:106624:60"/>not forſeit the Childs right, in as much as if this ſence were true, the Child received not its right from the next Parent, but from <hi>Abraham</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, one of whoſe Seed this Child is; and hence it will unavoidably follow that either the whole Race and Poſterity of <hi>Abraham,</hi> at leaſt in their infancy, before an actual ſorfeiture made by themſelves, muſt be under this Promiſe, and conſequently in a Covenant-relation with God, or elſe God hath failed in making good his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe; neither of which thoſe that contend for this ſence will affirm; therefore this ſence and meaning muſt unavoidably be relinquiſhed, and there being no other ſence and meaning. ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable, we muſt neceſſarily adhere to that afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given. And indeed ſhould we not underſtand this Promiſe in the extent and latitude, and with thoſe limitations before expreſſed, one of thoſe abſurdities will neceſſarily follow: for if ſo be we ſhould underſtand it of all <hi>Abraham</hi>'s natural Seed, univerſally, both immediately and medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately deſcending from him, God muſt either be their God, or fail in his Promiſe, they receiving their right to, and intereſt in the promiſes, not from their immediate parents, as included with them in that phraſe, <hi>their generations,</hi> but from <hi>Abraham</hi> himſelf; which right and intereſt they could not looſe by the ſin of any inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate parent, they being, notwithſtanding the ſin of ſuch a parent, ſtill <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Seed. And it being impoſſible, that they themſelves, afore they are born, ſhould forfeit their own right to it; and if we ſhould grant, that parents and
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:106624:61"/>children were included in that phraſe, <hi>their generations,</hi> and not limit the promiſe to the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular generations of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Seed, that is, to parents and their immediate children, the ſame abſurdity will follow; for then the Seed of the Jews, who in their own perſons forfeited their own right, would yet have a right to it, by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of the promiſe, as made to their progenitors in one or more generations paſt; and if ſo be the natural Seed of <hi>Abraham</hi> ſhould convey a right to the promiſe, meerly as ſuch, <hi>viz.</hi> as <hi>Abraham</hi>'s natural Seed, without conſideration had to their own abiding in Covenant, ſtill the ſame abſurdities will follow; either the Infant-ſeed of the Jews muſt ſtill be under the promiſe, or God is not faithful to his promiſes, neither of which will be affirmed (as I judge) by our Oppoſers. Now then this being the true ſence and meaning of this promiſe, the truth pleaded for is paſt all queſtion evident, <hi>viz.</hi> That as God promiſed <hi>Abraham,</hi> with reference to his natural Seed, immediately deſcending from him, that he would be a God to him, and them in their generations,; ſo with reference to his my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical Seed, <hi>viz.</hi> Believing Gentiles, that he would be a God to him and them in their gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, the promiſe being made to <hi>Abraham</hi>'s whole Seed, whether natural or myſtical, that God would be a God to them in their genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; and ſurely believing Gentiles are <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>'s Seed, as well as his Children proceeding from his own loins, as ſhall be evidenced more fully by and by. But that is the firſt Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:106624:61"/>to prove that the ſence and meaning given, according to the extent, and latitude, and the limitations afore expreſſed, is the true and genuine ſence and meaning of this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 2. My ſecond Argument is this; God in his conſequent tranſactions and dealings with the Seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> in reference to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant-ingagements between him and them, hath expounded that Promiſe, according to the ſence and meaning afore given; then that muſt needs be the true ſence and meaning of it: but the former is true, therefore the latter. Sure if the after dealings of God with the Seed of <hi>Abraham</hi> do declare the ſence and meaning of that Promiſe to be as we have afore given it, we need not doubt but 'tis the true and genuine ſence and meaning of it; we cannot doubt but that God fully underſtands his own ſence and meaning in that, as well as in all other his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, we may well interpret promiſes as God himſelf doth, whether he do it in his Word or by his Works: Now that God hath expounded this promiſe, according to the ſence and mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing before given, is evident from that of <hi>Deut.</hi> 29.10, 11, 12, 13. For obſerve it, when God deals with <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Seed, in reference unto Covenant engagements between him and them, he takes in not only Parents, but their Infant-ſeed with them, and that as the accompliſhment of this very promiſe. God now enters Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with the whole Congregation, in that
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:106624:62"/>extent and latitude that he promiſed to <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> that he would be a God to his Seed in their generations, including Parents and Children; he did not only enter Covenant with the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, as he had before promiſed to <hi>Abraham,</hi> to be a God to him and his Seed, but he enters Covenant with their Children: that is, he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters Covenant with them in their generations; and his entring Covenant with theſe Children or Infants, could not be, as they were, of the natural Race and Poſterity of <hi>Abraham,</hi> for the Reaſons before given; for if that promiſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged God to enter Covenant with, or extend his Covenant to the Infants of theſe particular Parents, upon the account of their relation to <hi>Abraham,</hi> as of his Seed, there would be the ſame reaſon of continuing this Covenant-rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion between himſelf and all <hi>Abraham</hi>'s natural Race and Poſterity, while in their infancy, which he hath not done; and therefore he muſt needs take them now in upon the account of their immediate parents, by vertue of this promiſe, wherein he ingaged himſelf to be a God to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and his Seed in their generations: Beſides, he enters Covenant not only with the natural Seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> but with the Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers then amongſt them, and with their Seed, the Children of Strangers being ſtill admitted into Covenant together with their parents: So that the manner of his now entring covenant with theſe particular Parents and Children at this time, as a clear and expreſs explication of that phraſe, wherein the promiſe was firſt made
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:106624:62"/>to <hi>Abraham,</hi> with reference to his Seed, <hi>viz.</hi> That God would be a God to them in their ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration. And as the Covenant was entred in this extent and latitude, in which the promiſe was at firſt made, ſo with the ſame limitations, as is evident from the Commination denounced againſt him that ſhould apoſtatize to Idolatry, compare the twentieth with Chapter the thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth, verſe the twelfth and thirteenth; The Seed of Idolaters was to be deſtroyed with the parents themſelves, which could not have been, in caſe the promiſe had extended beyond the immediate Children: ſo that we have God himſelf expounding the true ſence and mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this promiſe, and thus he expounds it in the latitude, and yet with the limitations before expreſſed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 3. My third Argument is this, If the Prophets have interpreted this promiſe as to be fulfilled in Goſpel times, in the extent and latitude before expreſſed, then we are ſo to interpret and underſtand it: but the former is true, therefore the latter.</p>
               <p>But this will bring me to the ſecond way propoſed, for the evidencing of this our ſecond Propoſition, and therefore I ſhall not ſtay upon it at preſent</p>
               <p>From what hath been ſaid it evidently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, that this promiſe of the Covenant is to be underſtood according to the extent and lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, and yet with the limitations before given: This promiſe was made to <hi>Abraham</hi>'s whole
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:106624:63"/>Seed, and anſwerably to his myſtical Seed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving Gentiles, as well as to his natural Seed: Here is no limitation of the promiſe to either ſort or ſpecies of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Seed; 'tis no more limitted to his natural than to his myſtical Seed, nor to his myſtical than to his natural, but is made alike to both ſorts of Seed, whoever bear this relation to <hi>Abraham,</hi> as his Seed, they are the Subjects intended in this promiſe, or they are under this promiſe, That God will be a God to them in their generations: Every be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving Gentile ſtands related to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and anſwerably is to be looked upon in the ſame ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity, with reference to this promiſe, as <hi>Iſaac</hi> did, though the foundation of the relation be different; yet the relation it ſelf is one and the ſame, and the capacity of both, with reference to the Promiſe, alike, that we may ſay as the Apoſtle to ſomething a different purpoſe, <hi>We Brethren are as Iſaac was,</hi> we ſtand alike related to <hi>Abraham,</hi> as he did, and are the joynt Subjects of the promiſe with him: ſo that as God pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to <hi>Abraham,</hi> with reference unto him, that we would be a God to him in his genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſo he promiſed to <hi>Abraham,</hi> with reference to us believing Gentiles, that he would be a God to us in our generations, that phraſe including, as then ſo ſtill, Parents and Children: and that which gives further evidence to this truth is, that <hi>Abraham</hi>'s natural Seed, as grown up, held their own intereſt, and conveyed an actual right to and intereſt, in the promiſe, to their Children not as they were <hi>Abraham</hi>'s natural Seed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:106624:63"/>but as they were his myſtical Seed (that is) did walk in the ſteps of his ſaith and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience. Now let any man ſhew any reaſon why the promiſe in that extent and latitude ſhould be reſtrained to <hi>Abraham</hi>'s natural Seed, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally they, as grown up, inheriting the promiſe themſelves, and conveying a right to it to their Children, as his myſtical Seed, and not as his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural; I ſay, let any man ſhew any ſolid reaſon, why the promiſe in that extent and latitude ſhould be reſtrained to them, and why the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles ſhould not enjoy it in the ſame extent and latitude that they did, ſeeing that God hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to be a God to <hi>Abraham</hi> and his whole Seed in their generations; certainly no rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal ground can be given, and therefore we may poſitively conclude, that this promiſe, in the full latitude and extent of it, is given and confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to, and ſetled upon believing Gentiles, in the very firſt making of it unto <hi>Abraham.</hi>

               <argument>
                  <p>The ſecond way of the foregoing Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions confirmation propoſed and proſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; where it is proved, that by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes and Propheſies of the old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, relating to new Teſtament times, the good contained in this Promiſe is ſetled upon, and confirmed to, ſome under the Covenant of Grace in new Teſtament times, and that it is no way reſtrained unto theſe immediately and directly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in theſe Promiſes and Propheſies, and conſequently must needs be common to all under the ſame Covenant. The third way of the ſame Propoſitions con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation, where it is proved, that the good contained in the forementioned Promiſe is, by the expreſs letter of the new Teſtament, ſetled upon and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed to believing Gentiles; the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture wherein that ſettlement is made produced: Objections of the ſaid ſettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment anſwered.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>SEcondly, The truth of this our ſecond Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition is further evident from the Promiſes
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:106624:64"/>and Propheſies of the old Teſtament; and thus the good contained in this Promiſe made to <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> is, in the extent and latitude before expreſt, given and confirmed to, and ſetled upon believing Gentiles, by the Promiſes and Propheſies of the old Teſtament, referring and relating to new Teſtament times: And thus we argue, What good is by promiſe and propheſie given to, and ſetled upon ſome under the Covenant of Grace in new Teſtament times, is by the ſame promiſe and propheſie given to, and ſetled upon all under the ſame Covenant, unleſs it be reſtrained to that ſome either by the nature and quality of the good it ſelf, or by ſome expreſs revelation of the will of God; but this good, <hi>viz.</hi> To have God a God to them and their Infant-ſeed, is by promiſe and propheſie given to, and ſetled upon ſome under the Covenant of Grace in new Teſtament times, and is not reſtrained to that ſome, either by the nature of the good it ſelf, or by any expreſs revelation of the will of God; therefore that good muſt needs by the ſame Propheſies and Promiſes be given to, and ſetled upon all under the ſame Covenant.</p>
               <p>The Major propoſition cannot be denied, without utterly razing the foundation of the faith and comfort of all believers. For what is the foundation of the faith and comfort of each particular Believer but this, That what good is promiſed to any particular Believers, and no wayes reſtrained to thoſe in particular to whom the Promiſe was firſt made, is promiſed to all that are under the ſame Covenant with them:
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:106624:65"/>and thus the Apoſtle directs us to apply Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes made to particular Believers, yea, when there might ſeem to be ſome ſhew of reaſon to reſtrain the good promiſed to thoſe in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar to whom it was immediately made; the Apoſtle applying that Promiſe made to <hi>Joſhua,</hi> concerning <hi>Gods never leaving nor forſaking him,</hi> to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> is our ſufficient direction in this matter.</p>
               <p>For the Minor propoſition, that only can be queſtioned; for the proof of which I ſhall, the Lord aſſiſting, do theſe three things.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Inſtance in, and aſſign the perſons, who in new Teſtament times have by the Promiſes and Propheſies of the old Teſtament this good given to, and ſetled upon them.</p>
               <p>Secondly, I ſhall prove, that 'tis one and the ſame Covenant of Grace that they are under, as having this good given unto them, and that believing Gentiles in general are under.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, That this good is not reſtrained to them in particular, to whom it is by promiſe and propheſie given, either of theſe wayes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore mentioned, and conſequently not at all.</p>
               <p>For the firſt, And thus I need do no more, but produce ſuch old Teſtament Promiſes and Propheſies, as by which this good, of having God a God to them and their Infant-ſeed, is given to, and ſetled upon ſome under the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:106624:65"/>of Grace in new Teſtament times: The perſons, or that ſort or ſpecies of perſons in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended in them, is ſufficiently evident from theſe Promiſes and Propheſies themſelves. Look in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to theſe Scriptures, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 59.21. and 65.25. and 44 3, 4. <hi>Jer.</hi> 3.12. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 37.21. and 22. and compare all theſe places with <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.26. That all theſe Promiſes and Propheſies refer to the Jews, as yet to be called and brought home unto Chriſt, will not be denyed by any. And this good, <hi>viz.</hi> To have God to be a God to them, and their Infant-ſeed with them, is given to, and ſetled upon them by theſe Promiſes and Propheſies, is ſure paſt all rational doubt: If all theſe Promiſes and Propheſies, concerning Gods pouring his Spirit upon them and their Seed; concerning his continuing his Word and Spirit in their mouths, from one generation to another; concerning his being a God to all their families, not only of their perſons, but ſamilies; concerning their Children being as aforetime, and the like; eſpecially the Apoſtle expounding all theſe Promiſes and Propheſies by that univerſal phraſe, <hi>All Iſrael,</hi> do not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently aſſure the Jews, that when they are brought home unto Chriſt, they ſhall enjoy this good in the latitude and extent expreſt, I ſee not how we can poſſibly be ſure of any thing held forth by way of promiſe and propheſie, yea, or how we can be aſſur'd of any thing paſt, that is declar'd to us by Scripture-hiſtory. Certainly we muſt wholly deſpair of under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding any thing God ſpeaks to us in his
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:106624:66"/>Word; if we doubt whether the foremention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Promiſes and Propheſies do aſſure the Jews of that forementioned good. Therefore we may poſitively conclude, having ſuch an abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant, yea, ſuperabundant evidence from Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture for it, that the Jews, when the veil is taken off from their hearts, and they that turned to to the Lord ſhall enjoy this good, in the ſame la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude and extent that their Father <hi>Abraham</hi> did.</p>
               <p>Secondly, That it is one and the ſame Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant into which the Jews (the perſons to whom this good is by theſe Promiſes and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſies given) ſhall be received, and believing Gentiles in generations are under; this is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, paſt all rational contradiction, by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring <hi>Jer.</hi> 31, 31. with <hi>Hebr.</hi> 8 8. We plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſee, that the Apoſtle takes it for granted, that the Covenant that God promiſes to make with the Jews at their future calling and converſion, is the Covenant now made with believing Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles; ſo that though ſome, though groundleſly, ſuppoſe, that Covenant made with <hi>Abraham</hi> was not the ſame with that believing Gentiles are now under: yet none can pretend, that the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant under which believing Gentiles are, and that to be made with the Jews, at the time fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned, are different or diſtinct Covenants. Suppoſe the Apoſtle tell us, that God made another Covenant with Believers than that he made with <hi>Iſrael</hi> of old (then that he made with <hi>Abraham</hi> it is no where ſaid) yet they
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:106624:66"/>cannot ſay there is the leaſt intimation that God will make another Covenant with the Jews, different from that we are now under. Now then the Covenant being one and the ſame, the promiſes of that Covenant are indifferently to be applyed unto all under it: And for the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther confirmation of this, let it be obſerved, that the Apoſtle doth frequently apply theſe promiſes, which are to have their full accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment to the Jews, to the Goſpel Church under this preſent adminiſtration: compare <hi>Iſai.</hi> 54.1. with <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.27. That promiſe in in the letter directly reſpects the Jews, yet the Apoſtle applyes it, as fulfilled inchoatively, in the converſion of the Gentiles: So compare <hi>Hoſea</hi> 1, 11. and 2.23. with <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.25, 26. So once again, compare <hi>Amos</hi> 9.11. with <hi>Acts</hi> 15.26. So that it is evident, that the Covenant, then to be made with, or into which the Jews ſhall be received, is the very ſame with that now made with believing Gentiles, and anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably thoſe promiſes, that ſhall have their full accompliſhment to the Jews, are applicable to believing Gentiles.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, That this good, of having God a God to Parents and their Infant-ſeed, is not reſtrained to the Jews, by either of the wayes before mentioned, and conſequently not at all: Who can imagine that believing Gentiles ſhould be leſs capable of injoying this good, than the Jews will be at their converſion? Why may not God be a God to Believers and their Seed now,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:106624:67"/>as well as to Believers and their Seed hereafter? Why may not God be a God to a believing Gentile and his Seed, as well as to a believing Jew and his Seed? Can any prove, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving Gentiles are abſolutely incapable of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying this good, in the full latitude and extent of it? They will ſay ſomething to the invali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dating of this Argument: Suppoſe it ſhould be granted (which yet I ſee no reaſon for) that the Seed of the Jews will be more capable of being the Subjects of the Covenant and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe thereof, than the Seed of Believers now are; yet unleſs they prove, that the Seed of Believers are abſolutely uncapable of being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived into, as joynt Subjects with their parents of the Covenant, and promiſe thereof, they ſay nothing to the purpoſe; in as much as whatever difference, in point of capability or incapability, may be aſſigned between the Seed of Believers then, and the Seed of Believers now, in regard of the different manner of this and that admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration, yet that is no reaſon why we may not apply theſe promiſes to believing Gentiles, to have their firſt accompliſhment in and among them, according to the manner of this preſent adminiſtration, as well as the Jews may apply them to themſelves, and injoy the accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of them in a way ſutable to that more excellent and glorious adminiſtration: and as for the other way of Gods reſtraining the good of promiſes to ſome particular perſons, <hi>viz.</hi> by the expreſs revelation of his will, let any ſuch revelation of the will of God, in the matter
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:106624:67"/>under conſideration, be produced, and I ſhall put an end to this controverſie; and unleſs this good, in the extent and latitude before expreſt, be ſome way reſtrained to the Jews, we may po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitively conclude, that the promiſe made to <hi>Abraham,</hi> with reference to his Seed, is by the forementioned promiſes and propheſies con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed to, and ſetled upon believing Gentiles, in the full latitude and extent in which it was given unto <hi>Abraham, viz.</hi> That God will be a God to them in their generations, that is, to them and their Seed. We may lay down this general rule, That whatever Promiſes or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſies are given out by the Prophets in the old Teſtament, directly referring and relating to the Jews at their call and converſion, yet unleſs the good contained in them be ſome way reſtrained to them in particular, we may and ought to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply them to the new Teſtament Church, and the particular members of it, under this preſent adminiſtration. The application made by the Apoſtle of Promiſes and Propheſies directly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring unto them, to the new Teſtament Church, and the particular Members thereof is a ſufficient warrant for our ſo doing. As now for inſtance take that promiſe, <hi>Amos</hi> 9.11. concerning the building up the Tabernacle of <hi>David,</hi> in the letter of it, it hath a direct refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to the future converſion of the Jews, yet we ſee, <hi>Acts</hi> 15 16. the Apoſtle applyes it to the erecting and building up of the Goſpel Church among the Gentiles. Now the Prophet <hi>Jere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miah</hi> tells us, how God will build up this Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:106624:68"/>of <hi>David,</hi> of and among the Jews, he will do it, by taking in their reſpective families, which muſt needs take in Parents and Children into Covenant with himſelf, <hi>He will be a God to all the families of the houſe of Iſrael.</hi> Now let any rational account be given, why we may not apply that promiſe in <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> expreſſing the manner of Gods raiſing up this tabernacle, to his raiſing it up from among the Gentiles, as well as the Apoſtle applyes that promiſe it ſelf to the gathering the Church from among them; doubtleſs no reaſon, that hath ſo much as a probable ſhew of reaſon or truth in it, can be given.</p>
               <p>And whereas it may be ſaid, there are ſome things ſpoken in <hi>Jeremiah</hi> 31. which cannot be applied to believing Gentiles.</p>
               <p>To that I anſwer, 'Tis granted: But that hinders not at all, but that what is applicable to them, may and ought to be applied unto them, in that promiſe, concerning the building up of the Tabernacle of <hi>David;</hi> as it refers to the converſion of the Jews, there is ſomething which is not applicable to the Gentiles: yet that hinders not, but that the promiſe, ſo far as applicable to them, was intended of them, and accompliſhed in the beginning of it, in their converſion: So now God, as being the God of all the families of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> will, when the Jewiſh Church cometh up to the fulneſs of her glory, communicate himſelf in a more full, glorious, and univerſal manner, in reſpect of the indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual Members of each family, than now he
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:106624:68"/>doth; yet that hinders not at all, but that that promiſe was intended of the families of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> as gathered from among the Gentiles, as the Apoſtle calls the Gentile Church, <hi>the Iſrael of God,</hi> and is begun to be accompliſhed, according to the true intent of it, under this preſent ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration. But that's for the ſecond way of evidencing the truth of this our ſecond Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The truth of what we affirm in this ſecond Propoſition may be evidenced from the expreſs letter of the new Teſtament, this promiſe made to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and that in the ſame extent and latitude in which it was made to him, is confirmed to, and ſetled upon believing Gentiles, by the expreſs letter of the new Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament. Thus in <hi>Galatians</hi> 3.13, 14. <hi>Chriſt,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>hath redeemed us from the curſe of the Law, being made a curſe for us, that the bleſſing of</hi> Abraham <hi>might come on the Gentiles, through Jeſus Chriſt, that we might receive the Promiſe of the Spirit through faith.</hi> The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle we ſee here doth poſitively affirm, that the very end of Chriſt, redeeming the Gentiles from the curſe of the Law, was their poſſeſſing <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>'s bleſſing, and conſequently is the immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate iſſue and reſult of a Gentiles redemption or deliverance from the curſe of the Law, through Chriſt, as believed in. No ſooner is a believing Gentile freed from the curſe of the Law, by his faith in Chriſt, but he, as one of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Seed, hath <hi>Abraham</hi>'s bleſſing come upon him: For
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:106624:69"/>the clearing up the evidence given in to the truth of our foregoing Propoſition, by this Scripture I ſhall do theſe two things,</p>
               <p>Firſt, I ſhall prove, that this bleſſing of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham,</hi> ſaid to be come upon believing Gentiles, is that very good contained in that promiſe, wherein God ingaged himſelf to be a God to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and his Seed, and remove what Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections may be made to the contrary.</p>
               <p>Secondly, I ſhall prove, that this bleſſing is come upon the Gentiles, through Chriſt, in the ſame latitude and extent that it was given to <hi>Abraham,</hi> at the firſt eſtabliſhment of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with him.</p>
               <p>For the firſt, <hi>viz.</hi> That this bleſſing came up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Gentiles through Chriſt, is the good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the aforementioned promiſe: This is evident from the Context.</p>
               <p>Firſt, From verſe 16. where ſayes the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, <hi>Now unto</hi> Abraham <hi>and his Seed were the Promiſes made; he ſaid not, unto Seeds, as of many, but to thy Seed, which is Chriſt:</hi> This verſe 16, is added for the confirmation of what the Apoſtle had aſſerted in verſe 14 For the clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up of this we muſt obſerve, that by the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of the Spirit, in the latter clauſe of that verſe 14. and the bleſſing of <hi>Abraham,</hi> in the former clauſe of this verſe, one and the ſame good is intended. 'Tis true, <hi>Beza</hi> conceives two
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:106624:69"/>diſtinct bleſſings are intended, and therefore he adds that Copulative, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and takes that phraſe, <hi>The promiſe of the Spirit,</hi> by an Hebraiſm, for the Spirit promiſed; but that cannot be, for then as <hi>Pareus</hi> obſerves, it ſhould not have been, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, the promiſe of the Spirit, as it is, but <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, the Spirit of promiſe: and therefore by the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of the Spirit we muſt underſtand, either that ſpiritual promiſe, ſo <hi>Pareus,</hi> or rather that promiſe which God by his Spirit gave unto <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham,</hi> and which by the inſpiration of the Spirit is left upon record in the Scripture, and that is the promiſe containing the bleſſing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore mentioned; or if any ſhould underſtand it of the Spirit himſelf, taking it of his in-dwell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling preſence, they ſhall not be gain ſaid by me. And the meaning is this, Chriſt hath redeemed us from the curſe of the Law, that we, whether Jews or Gentiles, might receive the promiſe of the Spirit, (<hi>viz.</hi> that bleſſing promiſed to <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> by the Spirit) through faith in Chriſt, that is, that being united by faith unto Chriſt, and incorporated into him, as members of his my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical body, we might receive that bleſſing pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and now come upon the Gentiles through Chriſt: So that that which the Apoſtle aſſerts in this ver. 14. is this, that the bleſſing promiſed to <hi>Abraham</hi> is come upon the Gentiles, through their incorporation into Chriſt by faith; and this the Apoſtle proves in verſe 16. by the tenour of the promiſe wherein the bleſſing atorementioned is contained: The te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:106624:70"/>of the promiſe is this, not, I will be a God to thee and thy Seeds, but to thee and thy Seed, as intending only one ſpecies or kind of Seed, which the Apoſtle expounds to be Chriſt, that is, Chriſt myſtical. Now obſerve it, the Apoſtles urging the tenour of the promiſe, to prove that the bleſſing of <hi>Abraham</hi> is come upon the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riles, as he had afore affirmed it to be, in verſe 14 evidently declares, he muſt needs intend the bleſſing contained in that promiſe; if he had intended it of any other bleſſing than that good given to <hi>Abraham</hi> and his Seed by that promiſe, the tenour of that promiſe had not prov'd what he was to prove: ſo that it muſt needs be that bleſſing promiſed to <hi>Abraham,</hi> that the Apoſtle here affirms to be come upon believing Gentiles through Jeſus Chriſt. Now that this promiſe, by the tenour of which the Apoſtle prov'd what he had ſaid, verſe 14. is this very promiſe made to <hi>Abraham, Gen.</hi> 17.7. is evident paſt all doubt, in as much as the Apoſtle muſt needs refer to ſome promiſe made to <hi>Abraham</hi> and his Seed in that very phraſe, <hi>To thee and thy Seed;</hi> the ſtrength of the Apoſtles Argument lying in the manner of expreſſion, <hi>to thy Seed.</hi> Now we have no other promiſe containing a good competable to the Gentiles, expreſt in that phraſe but this only; ſo that it is evident, that this bleſſing, ſaid to be come upon the Gentiles through Chriſt, is that bleſſing contained in that very promiſe, wherein God ingaged to be a God to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and his Seed in their generations. As for that promiſe in <hi>Gen.</hi> 12.3. there is no
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:106624:70"/>mention at all of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Seed; and for that <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.19. unto which ſome ſeem to ſuppoſe the Apoſtle here hath reterence, there is no mention at all of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Seed, as ſuch, but of <hi>Iſaac</hi>'s; and beſides, 'tis not ſaid to thy Seed, but it is ſpoken of or concerning his Seed: But now, I ſay, the Apoſtle muſt needs refer to, and intend ſome promiſe, wherein this very phraſe, <hi>to thy Seed,</hi> is expreſly uſed: The ſtrength of this Argument, as I have ſaid, lying in the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of expreſſion, there being a myſtery in that phraſe, implying that the bleſſing of <hi>Abraham</hi> ſhould not be enjoyed by all that might lay claim to this relation to <hi>Abraham,</hi> as his Seed, but by his Seed which were of the faith, as the Apoſtle explains it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.13.</p>
               <p>Secondly, That the bleſſing ſaid to be come come upon the Gentiles through Chriſt, is that bleſſing contained in that promiſe of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, is evident from verſe 29 where ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>If ye be Chriſts, then are ye</hi> Abraham<hi>'s Seed, and heirs according to promiſe:</hi> Heirs of what? Why verſe 14 tells us, of the bleſſing of <hi>Abraham:</hi> But heirs according to what pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe? Why verſe 16. tells us, that promiſe made to the Seed of <hi>Abraham:</hi> Now how could they be heirs of that bleſſing, according to, or by vertue of that promiſe, unleſs the bleſſing they were heirs unto, were the bleſſing or good contained in that promiſe? Can any be heirs to a bleſſing, according to or by vertue of that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, in which that bleſſing is not contained?
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:106624:71"/>Or can a promiſe convey a right to that good which is not contained in it? who can imagine it? Therefore doubtleſs the bleſſing muſt needs be the bleſſing, contained in that promiſe made to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and his Seed in their generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, That the bleſſing of <hi>Abraham</hi> ſaid to be come upon believing Gentiles through Chriſt, is the bleſſing contained in that promiſe, is evident from verſe 9, where it is ſaid, they that are of the faith are bleſſed, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, with faithful <hi>Abraham,</hi> that is, bleſſed with the ſame bleſſing that <hi>Abraham</hi> was bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with: Now there is no bleſſing that <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> was bleſſed with, that can poſſibly come up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Gentiles, but only the bleſſing contained in this promiſe, and therefore that muſt needs be the bleſſing here intended.</p>
               <p>But three things will be objected againſt our taking this Scripture as an expreſs ſettlement of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s bleſſing, as it conſiſted in that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, of God being a God to him and his Seed, upon believing Gentiles.</p>
               <p>Firſt, It will be objected, That this bleſſing is not meant of that bleſſing with which <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> himſelf was bleſſed, but of that bleſſing promiſed to him, with reference to his Seed, which was, that God would be a God to them, as he was to <hi>Abraham</hi> himſelf.</p>
               <pb n="95" facs="tcp:106624:71"/>
               <p>To this I anſwer: It is all one, whether we underſtand it of the bleſſing promiſed to <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> with reference to himſelf or with reference to his Seed, in as much as the Promiſe made to <hi>Abraham</hi> himſelf, and that made to him with reference to his Seed, is one and the ſame: What God promiſed to <hi>Abraham, viz.</hi> That he would be a God to him and his natural Seed, that he promiſed to his Seed, <hi>viz.</hi> to be a God to them in their generations, that is, as before explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, to them and their Seed, and beſides, taking it ſo, the promiſe to <hi>Abraham</hi>'s natural Seed was, to them in their generations. And in like manner, as the Apoſtle here affirms, it runs to believing Gentiles, <hi>viz.</hi> to them in their gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, including Parents and Children: But if we compare this phraſe, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, the bleſſing of <hi>Abraham,</hi> with verſe 9. it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, it was the bleſſing wherewith <hi>Abraham</hi> himſelf was bleſſed; the bleſſing of <hi>Abraham,</hi> according to the propriety of the phraſe, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly ſignifies the bleſſing that <hi>Abraham</hi> himſelf injoy'd; and to be bleſſed with <hi>Abraham,</hi> to enjoy his bleſſing, and to inherit the good pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to him, with reference to his Seed, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends, in the language and diſputation of the Apoſtle, one and the ſame thing; an undeniable evidence, that the promiſe, as made to <hi>Abraham,</hi> with reference to his Seed, contained the very ſame good it contained as made to <hi>Abraham</hi> himſelf, the Father of that Seed. Now to him it was, to him and his Seed, that is, his natural Seed; and therefore it is the ſame to his Seed,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:106624:72"/>to them and their natural Seed, or which is all one, to them in their generations.</p>
               <p>Secondly, It will be objected, That this bleſſing is not meant of a relative good, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting in a Covenant-relation between God and <hi>Abraham,</hi> and his Seed, but is meant of theſe ſpiritual bleſſings of Reconciliation, Juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Adoption, and Eternal Life vouchſafed to <hi>Abraham,</hi> as perſonally conſidered; and 'tis granted, that <hi>Abraham</hi>'s bleſſing, conſiſting of theſe ſpiritual bleſſings, is come upon believing Gentiles, through Chriſt: But what is this to that promiſe made to <hi>Abraham,</hi> concerning Gods being a God to him, and his Seed in their generations, conſtituting an external Covenant-relation between God and them.</p>
               <p>To this I anſwer, This Objection will be obviated by the ſecond thing propoſed, for the clearing up of the ſettlement made of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>'s bleſſing upon believing Gentiles, by the expreſs letter of this Scripture: and therefore I ſhall only ſay thus much at preſent, that it is granted, the ſpiritual benefits or bleſſings now mentioned, were included in this bleſſing, ſaid here to be come upon the Gentiles through Chriſt, yet not excluſive of that relative good of a Covenant ſtate and relation between God and <hi>Abraham,</hi> and his Seed, but that is the firſt and primary good intended, and that which is the foundation of all the reſt, and in which they are all vertually included.</p>
               <pb n="97" facs="tcp:106624:72"/>
               <p>Thirdly, It will be further objected, That the bleſſing here ſaid to be come upon the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles through Chriſt, is not that bleſſing where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with <hi>Abraham</hi> himſelf was bleſſed, but that bleſſing promiſed to the Nations in him, and conſequently the Apoſtle intends not the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing contained in that promiſe of the Covenant, mentioned in that <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.7 but that bleſſing ſpoken of <hi>Gen.</hi> 12.3. where God Promiſes un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Abraham,</hi> that <hi>in him all the Nations of the earth ſhould be bleſſed:</hi> and that the Apoſtle intends it of that blehng contained in that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, and not of that bleſſing contained in that <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. appears from verſe the eighth of this third of <hi>Galatians,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To this I anſwer two things.</p>
               <p>Firſt, That though I freely grant, that this bleſſing, ſaid by our Apoſtle to be come upon the Gentiles, be that bleſſing with which 'twas promiſed to <hi>Abraham,</hi> That the Nations ſhould be bleſſed in him, yet it will not follow, that it is not the bleſſing or good contained in that grand promiſe of the Covenant, yea, that it is the bleſſing contained in that grand promiſe of the Covenant, is abundantly proved from what hath been already ſpoken. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,</p>
               <p>Secondly, I anſwer, That that bleſſing, with which God promiſed ſo to bleſs the Nations in <hi>Abraham,</hi> is the ſame bleſſing contained in that grand promiſe of the Covenant; and therefore
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:106624:73"/>the Apoſtle might have, and certainly hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to both theſe promiſes in this Chapter. For the clearing up of this, let it be obſerved, that there are three things conſiderable in this bleſſing promiſed to <hi>Abraham,</hi> with reference to the Nations of the Earth.</p>
               <p>Firſt, There is the matter of this bleſſing, and that is ſummarily, their having and enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God, as a God unto them and theirs.</p>
               <p>Secondly, There are the means of their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying that bleſſing, and theſe are either chief and principal, <hi>viz.</hi> Chriſt as removing the curſe of the Law, and purchaſing that bleſſing for them by his death and ſuffering. 2. The ſubordinate and leſs principal, <hi>viz. Abraham</hi> himſelf,</p>
               <p>Thirdly, There is the notion or conſideration under which they ſhould receive and injoy this bleſſing, and that is, as <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Seed.</p>
               <p>Now in that <hi>Gen.</hi> 12.3. we have a more ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral promiſe of this bleſſing, with which God intended to bleſs the Nations, and alſo a ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of the means, both ſupream and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal, and alſo ſubordinate and leſs principal, of their coming to the injoyment of it; they ſhould be bleſſed in <hi>Abraham,</hi> that is, in <hi>Abraham</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, as the leſs principal means; in Chriſt, the Seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> as the chief and principal means.</p>
               <pb n="99" facs="tcp:106624:73"/>
               <p>But in this <hi>Gen.</hi> 17 7. we have both the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the bleſſing aſure promiſed, and the notion under which they ſhould receive and injoy it; <hi>I will be,</hi> ſaith God, <hi>a God to thee and thy Seed often thee in theirs generations.</hi> The notion un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der which God promiſed to bleſs the Nations in <hi>Abraham</hi> is, as they were his Seed; the matter of the bleſſing is, that <hi>God would be a God to them in their generations;</hi> that is, to them and theirs. So that theſe two Promiſes, <hi>Gen.</hi> 12.3. and <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.7. are not two diſtinct Promiſes, containing two diſtinct bleſſings, but they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain one and the ſame bleſſing, and, as taken joyntly together, declare the full mind of God concerning his bleſſing the Nations of the Earth in <hi>Abraham.</hi> The ſum of all comes to thus much, That God would make <hi>Abraham</hi> as a Father of natural Children, from among whom the Meſſiah ſhould come; ſo a ſpiritual or myſtical Father, and anſwerably would, through the interpoſal of that one principal Member of his Seed, <hi>viz.</hi> Chriſt, be a God to him and his Seed, both natural and myſtical, in their generations, and conſequently. I the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Earth, whether of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Race or Poſterity, or of the Gentiles, that were deſigned to be bleſſed, ſhould be bleſſed in <hi>Abraham,</hi> as his Seed, or in him, as a common Father to them all: <hi>And in his Seed, viz.</hi> Chriſt, as the procuring cauſe of that their bleſſedneſs: Hence it is no wonder, though the Apoſtle, in ſpeaking of the way of the bleſſings coming upon the Gentiles, hath reference to both theſe
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:106624:74"/>promiſes, both, as I ſaid, taken together, and in conjunction one with the other, containing the full mind of God, concerning his bleſſing the world: As a cloſe of all let me add, that as God promiſed to bleſs the Nations in <hi>Abraham,</hi> as before opened, ſo he made <hi>Abraham</hi> himſelf a copy or pattern, according unto which he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to bleſs them in him, and that both in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the bleſſing it ſelf, with which he would bleſs them, and in reſpect of the terms and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of their poſſeſſing and inheriting that bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, <hi>viz.</hi> Through faith in Chriſt, expreſſing it ſelf in univerſal obedience.</p>
               <p>For the further proof of this, let it be obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that both the Hebrew prefix and the Greek prepoſition we tranſlate in, may be tranſlated after the manner, or according to: For the Greek, ſee <hi>Hebr.</hi> 4.11. whence <hi>Calvin</hi> gives the ſenſe thus, <hi>Non tantum ſignificat ipſum fore exemplar, ſed cauſam benedictionis. Junius</hi> and <hi>Tremelius</hi> give this gloſs, <hi>Familiae terrae tibi inſitae per fidem, participes fiunt harum promiſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num benedictionumque tuarum:</hi> And thus the Apoſtle expounds this promiſe, of being bleſſed in <hi>Abraham,</hi> by another phraſe, bleſſed with <hi>Abraham.</hi> Now then having proved, that this bleſſing, ſaid by the Apoſtle to be come upon the Gentiles through Chriſt, is that very bleſſing or good contained in that grand Promiſe of the Covenant, and that not only in that branch of it that refers to <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Seed, but in that branch referring directly unto <hi>Abraham</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, wherein God ingaged to be a God to him
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:106624:74"/>and his Seed, and conſequently that this is the bleſſing ſaid to be come upon the Gentiles.</p>
               <p>I come now to the ſecond thing propoſed, <hi>viz.</hi> to prove, that this bleſſing is come upon the Gentiles, in the ſame extent and latitude in which it was given to <hi>Abraham</hi> himſelf: Now this is ſufficiently evident from the alone conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of the indefiniteneſs and univerſality of the expreſſion, the bleſſing of <hi>Abraham,</hi> we ſee the Apoſtle affirms, the bleſſing of <hi>Abraham</hi> is come upon the Gentiles, without any reſtricti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or limitation, he doth not ſay, this or that part of the bleſſing, but the bleſſing abſolutely and unlimitedly.</p>
               <p>It is true, notwithſtanding the indefiniteneſs and univerſality of the Apoſtles expreſſion; yet in caſe any part of the bleſſing vouchſafed to <hi>Abraham</hi> be of that nature, as that the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles are ſimply and abſolutely incapable of it, or in caſe God himſelf hath any where elſe withheld any part of it from them, in this caſe a limitation and reſtriction muſt be underſtood, as neceſſarily implied in this general and univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal expreſſion; but otherwiſe we ought to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the Apoſtle, according to the full lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of his expreſſion, the bleſſing, that is, the whole bleſſing of <hi>Abraham</hi> is come upon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving Gentiles.</p>
               <p>And hence we argue: If the whole bleſſing of <hi>Abraham</hi> be come upon believing Gentiles. ſo far as they are capable of injoying it and God hath by no expreſs revelation of his will with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:106624:75"/>it from them, and this to have God a God to him and his natural Seed, was an eſſential part of his bleſſing, which believing Gentiles are capable of injoying, and God hath not by any revelation of his will withheld from them, then this part of his bleſſing is come upon them in the ſame extent and latitude in which it was given to <hi>Abraham:</hi> But the former is true, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the latter.</p>
               <p>It's true, If any man can make it appear, that this part of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s bleſſing, <hi>viz.</hi> Gods ingaging to be a God to his Seed with him, be a bleſſing the Gentiles are incapable of injoying, or that God by any expreſs revelation of his will, hath withheld that part of the bleſſing from them, we ſhall ceaſe any further claim to it.</p>
               <p>But as for the firſt, The incapacity of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving Gentiles to injoy this part of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s bleſſing, ſure none can pretend it; for ſuppoſe it ſhould be granted (which is not) that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers under this preſent diſpenſation are not in a like capacity to injoy this good, that Saints in future times will be; or that their Seed are not alike capable of that good the Seed of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers in thoſe times will be capable of: Yet none can ſay, that either believers, or their Seed, are incapable of what <hi>Abraham</hi> and his natural Seed were capable of: 'tis ſtrange how it is poſſible for any man to conceit ſuch a difference, either in the capacity of Parents or Children, or in the diſpenſation of God, that Believers under this preſent diſpenſation ſhould be whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:106624:75"/>deprived of that part of the bleſſing, which Believers formerly injoyed, and ſhall again injoy at the call and converſion of the Jews.</p>
               <p>And for the latter, Let any revelation of the will of God be produced, whereby he hath withheld this part of the bleſſing from Believers, and the controverſie is at an end. Till then we ſhall take it for granted, that the bleſſing of <hi>Abraham</hi> is in this extent and latitude, in and by Chriſt come upon believing Gentiles. And though it is granted, the direct deſign of the Apoſtle in this place is, not to aſſert the latitude and extent of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s bleſſing, yet the inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finiteneſs and univerſality of his expreſſion is a ſufficient warrant for our interpreting the bleſſing in this latitude and extent pleaded for.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>The fourth and laſt way of the ſecond ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate Propoſitions confirmation proſecuted. Where ſeveral paſſages in the New Teſtament are conſidered. Five Concluſions deduced from them; The third principally inſiſted upon; Where it is proved, that the Promiſe of Salvation appertains to the Houſes of believing Parents, as ſuch, without conſideration had to the perſonal Faith and Repentance of any in or of their Houſes, beſides their own, by two Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments. Objections againſt each Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument anſwered.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>FOurthly, The truth of what we affirm in this ſecond Propoſition may be further evidenced from ſeveral paſſages and expreſſions in the new Teſtament, plainly declaring, that the Infant-ſeed of Believers under the Goſpel adminiſtration, are included and taken in, as joynt Subjects with their Parents of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant and Promiſe thereof, and that by vertue of their Parents relation to <hi>Abraham,</hi> as his Seed.</p>
               <pb n="105" facs="tcp:106624:76"/>
               <p>Now this laſt way of evidencing what is pleaded for, though it might require a very large diſcourſe, yet I ſhall but briefly touch upon it, partly becauſe the truth pleaded for is, as I conceive, ſufficiently evidenced from what hath been already ſpoken, and partly becauſe others have already fully handled and improved theſe paſſages and expreſſions, I have reference unto, for the vindicating and eſtabliſhing this truth, I in common with them contend for; that to add any thing more, eſpecially there being ſo little, or rather nothing at all, replyed to any purpoſe by our Oppoſers, may ſeem wholly ſuperfluous; and therefore I ſhall only produce thoſe paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges and expreſſions in the new Teſtament, and ſhew what evidence they give into this ſecond Propoſition, in ſeveral Concluſions, neceſſarily flowing from, or grounded upon them, as taken together, and compared one with another.</p>
               <p>The Paſſages and Expreſſions I have reference unto, are theſe five.</p>
               <p>The firſt is that of Chriſt, <hi>Mark</hi> 10.10.</p>
               <p>The ſecond is again that of Chriſt, <hi>Luke</hi> 19.9.</p>
               <p>The third is that of <hi>Peter</hi> to the trembling Jews, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.38, 39.</p>
               <p>The fourth is that of <hi>Paul</hi> to the Jaylor, <hi>Acts</hi> 16.31.</p>
               <p>The laſt is that of <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.14.</p>
               <p>From all theſe Scriptures, as laid together, and compared one with another, theſe five Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſions do neceſſarily follow.</p>
               <pb n="106" facs="tcp:106624:77"/>
               <p>Firſt, That upon Parents believing in Chriſt, the Promiſe of ſalvation belongs not only to themſelves, but to their reſpective Houſes: ſayes the Apoſtle to the Jaylor, <hi>Believe in the Lord Jeſus, and thou ſhalt be ſaved, and thine Houſe:</hi> where we ſee the Apoſtle propoſes it as a motive and incouragement to him to believe, in that upon his believing, not only himſelf, but his houſe ſhould be ſaved, that is, both he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and his houſe ſhould come under the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of ſalvation; or as the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds it, <hi>The promiſe of ſalvation ſhould be to him and his houſe:</hi> he and his houſe ſhould have ſalvation ſetled upon them by promiſe, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the true tenour of the promiſe, which as it did not ſecure ſalvation to the Jaylor himſelf abſolutely, but upon condition of his perſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance in faith and obedience; <hi>He that indures to the end ſhall be ſaved: Be faithful unto the death, and I will give thee a Crown of life,</hi> ſaith Chriſt to that Church, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.10. from which and the like Scripture it appears, that the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of ſalvation, that Believers themſelves are under, is not abſolute but conditional; and the ſame muſt be underſtood of the promiſes, as made to their houſes, which through their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents believing they are brought under,</p>
               <p>And as the Apoſtle promiſes ſalvation to the Jaylor and his houſe, as a motive and incourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to him to believe, ſo Chriſt tells <hi>Zacheus,</hi> that upon his believing, ſalvation was come to his houſe, that is, he and his houſe were now under the promiſe of ſalvation.</p>
               <pb n="107" facs="tcp:106624:77"/>
               <p>As for that conceit of ſome, that by ſalvation here Chriſt himſelf ſhould be intended; as it is wholly groundleſs, ſo an evident perverting of the words of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>For firſt, Let it be ſhewed where Chriſt is ever called ſalvation ſimply and abſolutely; 'tis true, he is called Gods ſalvation, and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers have appropriated him to themſelves as their ſalvation, but that is as he is Author or Eſſicient of Salvation: This term <hi>Salvation,</hi> when uſed ſimply and abſolutely, ſignifies Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion properly and literally taken.</p>
               <p>Secondly, It is evident, that Salvation here is ſaid to be come to <hi>Zacheus</hi> his houſe, as a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar good accrewing to him upon that very ground, and vouchſafed to him for that very reaſon, becauſe he was now a Son of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and conſequently was a good common to all, of whom the ſame ground and reaſon might be predicated or ſpoken, and peculiar and proper to them as ſuch. Now as Chriſt did not come to all their houſes, who were the Children of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham,</hi> whether natural or myſtical, ſo he might come to their houſes, who were not the Sons of <hi>Abraham,</hi> in the one or the other ſence.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The Apoſtle doth clearly expound the meaning of Chriſt, <hi>Salvation was come to his houſe;</hi> that is, as the Apoſtle expounds it, He and his houſe were under the promiſe of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Now did not men too wilfully ſhut their
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:106624:78"/>eyes againſt the light of Scripture, they would not affix a ſence upon the words of Chriſt, no where warranted from any other parallel Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but contrary to the deſign of Chriſt in them, when they have a plain Expoſition made by the Holy Ghoſt himſelf: we ſee what Chriſt ſaith of <hi>Zacheus</hi>'s houſe, and the Apoſtle promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes the Jaylor, with reference to his houſe, that is ſaid and promiſed upon one and the ſame ground, <hi>viz.</hi> the Father of both: Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation is come to his houſe;</hi> he now believing, the Apoſtle ſaith, his houſe ſhall be ſaved upon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of his believing. And who can imagine, but that they both ſpeak of ſalvation in one and the ſame ſence, and conſequently that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle expounds what that ſalvation was, that Chriſt ſaith was come to <hi>Zacheus,</hi> upon his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving, 'twas the ſame kind of ſalvation that he promiſes to the Jaylor, upon condition of his believing.</p>
               <p>The ſecond Concluſion. Thus under this term <hi>Houſe,</hi> Children are, in a peculiar and ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial manner, included and comprehended: How far this term <hi>Houſe,</hi> is to be extended, whether beyond the Children of thoſe, whoſe houſe is ſpoken of, or no, concerns not my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent purpoſe; that they are included and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended under that term <hi>Houſe,</hi> is all that at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent I affirm. Now that the Children are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, is evident, partly from that phraſe, <hi>Acts</hi> 16.33. where <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, thy houſe, verſe 31. is expounded by this phraſe, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, all of
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:106624:78"/>him, and partly from the frequent acceptation of this term <hi>Houſe</hi> throughout the Scripture; it being peculiarly appropriated to the Children: Or ſhould the term be more comprehenſive, yet it cannot rationally be ſuppoſed to exclude them: And yet 'tis further evident by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle <hi>Peter,</hi> where ſaith he, <hi>The Promiſe is to you and your Children:</hi> What Promiſe? Why the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> tells us, the promiſe of Salvation, <hi>The Promiſe is to thee and thy houſe,</hi> ſaith <hi>Paul</hi> to the Jaylor. But who are we to underſtand by <hi>Houſe?</hi> Why <hi>Peter</hi> tells us, his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. Hence again, as for that conceit of others, that the meaning ſhould be, that ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was come only to him, and in that it was come to him, it might be ſaid, it was come to his houſe, 'tis too palpable a perverting the mind of Chriſt: For let it be obſerved, that by Salvation here, is meant Salvation in a proper ſence as hath been already proved; and that by <hi>Houſe</hi> here, cannot be meant that material building wherein he dwelt, but his Houſhold or Family. Now how Salvation could be ſaid to be come to his Houſhold, in that it was come to him, when as his Houſhold was no wayes inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſted or concerned in it, is hard to imagine; properly it could not be ſaid to be come to his houſe, himſelf was not properly his houſe: So that this interpretation muſt needs ſuppoſe, that Chriſt here ſpeaks figuratively. Now let it be obſerved, how utterly improbable it is, that Chriſt ſhould uſe a figurative ſpeech, that had a direct tendency to lead men into a miſtake about
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:106624:79"/>his ſence and and meaning, when he might have expreſt himſelf without any figure, in as few and as intelligible words, and thereby prevented the danger of his being miſtaken: Had Chriſt intended that Salvation was come only to <hi>Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheus</hi> himſelf, it had been as eaſie for him to have ſaid, Salvation is come to this man, as to ſay, Salvation is come to this houſe, and that this phraſe, <hi>this houſe,</hi> did ſubject men to the danger of miſtaking his ſence and meaning, in caſe he had ſpoken figuratively, is ſufficiently evident becauſe that term <hi>Houſe,</hi> is ſo frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, yea, conſtantly and univerſally uſed in a ſence different from what this interpretation ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth that Chriſt did uſe it in this place, that term <hi>Houſe,</hi> being conſtantly and univerſally uſed to ſignifie the Family or Children of thoſe, whoſe houſe is ſpoken of, unleſs when it ſignifies the material building it ſelf: How many hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred places might be inſtanced in, as an evidence of this? Let it be ſhewed whereever this term <hi>Houſe</hi> is uſed as it is ſuppoſed to be in this inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation: neither is it, as I judge, a phraſe to be parallel'd in any Language whatſoever, that any good or evil ſhould be ſaid to be come to a houſe that is, the Family or Houſhold when it is come only to one in the houſe, having no reference to any beyond the particular perſon himſelf, is an expreſſion not to be parallel'd throughout the whole Scriptures: but now 'tis the conſtant phraſe of Scripture, to expreſs the Family, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the Children, by that term <hi>Houſe;</hi> 'tis wholly ſuperfluous to enumerate places; ſo
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:106624:79"/>that ſhould this term <hi>Houſe</hi> be uſed thus impre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly by Chriſt in this place, it muſt needs ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject all men to the danger of miſtaking his ſence and meaning, and the danger muſt needs be the greater, becauſe the good, <hi>viz.</hi> Salvation, ſaid here to be come to his houſe, is ſo frequently, both in the old and new Teſtament, held forth, at leaſt very probably, to ſay no more at preſent, in ſuch an extent and latitude as to reach the whole Family, eſpecially the Children together with their Parents; thus it was promiſed to <hi>Abraham,</hi> that <hi>the Families of the Earth ſhould be bleſſed in him:</hi> So God promiſes, that he would be the God of all the Families of <hi>Iſrael. Paul</hi> tells the Jaylor, that he and his houſe ſhould be ſaved. <hi>Peter</hi> tells his awakened hearers, the promiſe was to them and their Children, that is, in an equivalency to them and their houſes. Now when it is found in ſuch va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of paſſages, that the promiſe of Salvation ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to whole houſes upon the believing of the Parents, men muſt needs be very apt to conceive, that Chriſt uſes this term <hi>Houſe,</hi> in a ſence cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondent to thoſe various paſſages, wherein the ſame good is at leaſt probably held forth in ſuch a latitude and extent, as to reach the whole houſes of believing Parents. Now I ſay, can we imagine that Chriſt ſhould uſe a phraſe in ſuch a ſence, as the whole Scripture is unacquainted with, and which is conſtantly uſed in another ſence, and thereby ſubject all men to ſo great danger of miſtaking his ſence and meaning, and that alſo to the upholding of
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:106624:80"/>what himſelf, according to the judgments of our Oppoſers, he was about to throw down, when he might have expreſt himſelf with as much eaſe, &amp; alike intelligibly, in proper terms, no way liable to be miſtaken, methinks it is very ſtrange how it is poſſible for any man to imagine it: So that doubtleſs Chriſt ſpeaks properly, Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation was come to <hi>Zacheus</hi> his houſe, that is, the promiſe of Salvation did belong to his houſe, in ſpecial to his Children: and this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, as already obſerved, with that promiſe of <hi>Paul</hi> to the Jaylor, <hi>Thou ſhalt be ſaved and thy houſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, That the promiſe of Salvation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to the houſes of believing Parents, meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as ſuch, without conſideration had to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal faith and repentance of any in, or of their reſpective houſes, and conſequently the promiſe of Salvation may, and frequently doth belong to the houſes of believing Parents, antecedent to the perſonal faith and repentance of any in or of their houſes, beſides themſelves. What belongs to the houſes of believing Parents, as ſuch, that is, as the houſes of ſuch Parents, equally and alike belongs to all the houſes of all ſuch Parents, and conſequently may belong to the houſes of this or that particular believing Parent, when yet none in or of the houſe have perſonally believed or repented.</p>
               <p>Now the truth of this Concluſion will be evident by a twofold Argument.</p>
               <pb n="113" facs="tcp:106624:80"/>
               <p>Firſt, What belongs to the houſes of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving Parents, meerly by vertue of ſomething univerſally predicable of all ſuch Parents, muſt needs belong to their reſpective houſes, as ſuch, without conſideration had to the perſonal faith and repentance of any in or of their reſpective houſes: But the promiſe of Salvation belongs to the houſes of believing Parents, by vertue of ſomething univerſally predicable of all ſuch Parents; and therefore the promiſe of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion muſt needs belong to all their reſpective houſes, as the houſes of ſuch Parents, without conſideration had to the perſonal faith and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance of any in or of this houſe.</p>
               <p>The Major propoſition cannot be denyed; for if the promiſe of Salvation belong to the hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of believing Parents, meerly by vertue of ſomething univerſally predicable of all ſuch Parents, certainly then none can queſtion, but that the promiſe belongs to thoſe houſes, as the houſes of ſuch Parents, without conſideration had to any thing in, or done by the houſes them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, or any in or of them. If freedom in ſuch a Town or Corporation ſhall belong to the Children of Free-men, meerly by vertue of their Parents freedom, ſure none could queſtion, but that freedom did belong to them, as the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of ſuch Parents, without conſideration had to any thing in reſpect of the Children them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
               <p>For the Minor propoſition: and thus I have three things to do.</p>
               <pb n="114" facs="tcp:106624:81"/>
               <p>Firſt, To ſhew what is that thing predi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable of believing Parents, by vertue of which the promiſe of Salvation belongs to their reſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive houſes.</p>
               <p>Secondly, To prove, that the promiſe of Salvation doth indeed belong to the houſes of ſuch Parents, meerly by vertue of that thing pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicable of them.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, To prove, that that thing, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it be, is univerſally predicable, or is univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally true of all ſuch Parents.</p>
               <p>For the firſt, And thus in brief, That thing predicable of believing Parents, by vertue of which the promiſe of Salvation belongs to their reſpective houſes, is their relation unto <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> as his Seed: Therefore ſhaith Chriſt of <hi>Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheus</hi> his houſe, <hi>This day is Salvation come to this houſe, for as much as he is the Son of Abraham:</hi> 'Tis his Sonſhip to <hi>Abraham,</hi> or his relation to <hi>Abraham,</hi> as one of his Seed, that intereſted his houſe in the promiſe of Salvation.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Which is the main thing to be proved, That the promiſe of Salvation doth belong to the houſes of believing Parents, meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by vertue of their Parents relation unto <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham,</hi> as his Seed Now this is evident from that paſſage of Chriſt concerning <hi>Zacheus</hi> his houſe, <hi>Salvation is come to this houſe, for as much as he alſo is a Son of Abraham,</hi> that by <hi>houſe</hi> is
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:106624:81"/>not meant <hi>Zacheus</hi> himſelf, is before proved; it muſt needs be meant of his Houſhold, or Family, peculiarly intending his Children. Now ſayes Chriſt, <hi>Salvation is come to this houſe,</hi> that is to this Houſhold or Family, <hi>for as much as he is a Son of Abraham.</hi> Whether <hi>Zacheus</hi> was a Jew or a Roman is all one as to my purpoſe, ſeeing he is conſidered here. not as a natural, but as a myſtical Son of <hi>Abraham;</hi> and as ſuch a one, Chriſt affirms, Salvation was come to his houſe; plainly grounding his houſes right to, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in Salvation, upon his own relation to <hi>Abraham,</hi> as one of his Seed: Salvation was not only to himſelf, but to his houſhold, by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of his relation to <hi>Abraham,</hi> as one of his Seed, and that the promiſe of Salvation belongs to the houſes of ſuch Parents, meerly by vertue of that their relation to <hi>Abraham,</hi> is evident, becauſe the Scripture aſſigns nothing elſe as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily to concur with that their Parents rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion unto <hi>Abraham,</hi> for the effecting or produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing their houſes right to, and intereſt in the promiſe: Chriſt tells us here, That Salvation was come to this mans houſe by vertue of his relation unto <hi>Abraham;</hi> and let it be ſhewed, where any thing elſe is required, for the effecting or producing that their intereſt in, and right to the promiſe.</p>
               <p>It may be ſome will ſay, 'Tis eaſily done, the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> makes effectual calling a neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary prerequiſite to the Seed of believing Parents intereſt in, and right to the promiſes: for ſaith
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:106624:82"/>he, <hi>The Promiſe is to you and your Children, and to all that are afar off, even to as many as the Lord our God ſhall call.</hi> Whence it ſeems to be evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that notwithſtanding Parents relation to <hi>Abraham,</hi> as his Seed, yet the promiſe of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion appertains not to their Children, but upon ſuppoſition of their being effectually called.</p>
               <p>To that I anſwer two things (not to ſtay upon a vindication of that Text of the Apoſtle from the unſound ſence ſuppoſed in this Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection;</p>
               <p>Firſt, That Chriſt doth not ſay; Salvation ſhall come to this houſe, but he ſpeaks in the time paſt, Salvation is come: 'tis true, if it had been only a promiſe referring to the time to come, there had been ſome ſhew of colour for the ſuppoſing ſuch a condition to be implyed in it; but Chriſt ſaith, Salvation was then come, and that upon that ground, and for that reaſon, becauſe he alſo was a Son of <hi>Abraham,</hi> Now ſhould we interpret this affirmation of Chriſt by that of the Apoſtle, according to the ſence given by our Oppoſers, his words would run thus, Salvation is come to this houſe; that is, to as many of them as the Lord our God ſhall call, which would be contradictory, for if it were come already, the coming of it could not depend upon a future condition. If the coming of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation did depend upon the performance of a future condition, it could not be ſaid to be come already; and therefore we muſt not interpret
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:106624:82"/>this paſſage of Chriſt by that of <hi>Peter,</hi> but that paſſage of <hi>Peter</hi> by that of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Secondly, I anſwer, That this was a good vouchſafed to <hi>Zacheus,</hi> upon the account of his relation to <hi>Abraham,</hi> as one of his Seed, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerably was a good common to all ſtanding alike related to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and proper and pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar unto them; but now to have the promiſe of Salvation upon condition of being effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally called, is a good conmon to all men uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally, and therefore the promiſe is ſaid to be to all whom the Lord our God ſhall call; but Salvation was cme to <hi>Zacheus</hi> his houſe as he was a Son of <hi>Abraham;</hi> ſo that we ſee it was meerly by vertue of his relation unto <hi>Abraham,</hi> that the promiſe of Salvation belongs to his houſe, Chriſt affirming that Sakvatuib was come by vertue of that his relation; and the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture being ſilent as to the neceſſary concurrence of any thing elſe for the intereſting his houſe in the promiſe of Salvation; we may poſitive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conclude, the promiſe of Salvation doth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to the houſes of all believing Parents, meerly by vertue of that their relation to <hi>Abraham</hi> as his Seed, eſpecially if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider,</p>
               <p>Thirdly, That this relation to <hi>Abraham</hi> is univerſally predicable of all believing Parents: All believing Parents are the Children of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> and conſequently this could be no privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge peculiar to <hi>Zacheus,</hi> to have Salvation come
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:106624:83"/>to his houſe, as he was a Son of <hi>Abraham,</hi> But is a priviledge common to all believing Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, they ſtanding alike related to <hi>Abraham</hi> as he did. So that the Minor Propoſition is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly true, whence the Concluſion will undoubtedly follow.</p>
               <p>My ſecond Argument is this, If the promiſe of Salvation may and ought to be applied by the diſpencers of the Goſpel to believing Parents, both with reference to themſelves and their Children, meerly as ſuch, that is, as believing Parents, without conſideration has to the perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal faith and repentance of any in or of their houſes, then the promiſe of Salvation muſe needs belong to them and their houſes, without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration had to the perſonal ſaith and repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of any in or of their houſes: but the former is true, therefore the latter.</p>
               <p>Certainly if a Miniſter of the Goſpel may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the promiſe of Salvation, not only to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving Parents themſelves, but to their houſes, then that promiſe belongs not only to them, but to their houſes: Miniſters may not apply pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes any other wayes then as they belong to thoſe to whom the application is made.</p>
               <p>Now that the promiſe of Salvation may and ought to be applyed in this extent and latitude, not only to believing Parents themſelves, but to their reſpective houſes, and that meerly as ſuch, without conſideration had to the perſonal faith and repentance of any in or of their houſes, is evident, paſt all rational contradiction, by the
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:106624:83"/>Apoſtles propoſing the promiſe in this extent and latitude to the Jaylor. As the Apoſtle did proplſe it to the Jaylor, as a motive to him to believe, it might and ought to have been applied to him upon his actual believing, he might have been aſſured, that now he and his houſe ſhould be ſaved, yet in that way, and according to that method, or upon the terms hold forth in the Covenant of Grace (an account of which we have already given.) And that the Apoſtle propoſes this promiſe in the extent and latitu de before expreſt to the Jaylor, upon condition of his own believing , without conſideration had to the perſonal faith and repentance of any in or of his houſe, is evident from the expreſs words of the Text, <hi>Thou ſhalt be ſaved and thy houſe;</hi> and conſequently might have been applied to him, as a Believer, upon his actual believing; and hence it appears, that this promiſe did not apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to him alone, it was not a priviledge peculiar to him, to have his houſe under the ſame promiſe with himſelf, but a priviledge common to all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving Barents. <hi>Quatenus ipſum, concludes de omni.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The only Objection I have met with is this; That as the Promiſe was made conditionally, to the Jaylor himſelf, ſo to his houſe, that is, as the Apoſtle promiſed to him, that if he believed he ſhould be ſaved; ſo he promiſed to him, with reference to his houſe, that if they believed they ſhould be ſaved, according to the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation given of that promiſe of <hi>Peter, Acts</hi> 2.39.</p>
               <pb n="120" facs="tcp:106624:84"/>
               <p>To that I anſwer, That though it is readily granted, that the promiſe, as externally propoſed, was conditionally both to himſelf, and his houſe, yet I ſay, that his own believing did give his houſe an actual right to, and intereſt in the promiſe (yet to be fulfilled, according to the terms of the Covenant) is evident, becauſe there could be no reaſon of the Apoſtles adding that other branch of the promiſe as a motive to him to believe, unleſs by his believing a peculiar good (which can be nothing elſe but this right to, and intereſt in the promiſe) did accrew to his houſe. It had been a ſtronger motive for the Apoſtle to have ſaid, Believe in the Lord Jeſus and thou ſhalt be ſaved, and all the Town, or Country, yea, all the World, If the Apoſtle had not intended a peculiar good, in relation to the ſalvation of his houſe, redounding to them by his believing, there had been no more reaſon for him to mention his houſe, than for him to have mentioned the whole Town or Country, or whole World, in as much as thev ſhould all be ſaved upon condition of their believmg.</p>
               <p>And hence, whereas when this conſideration is urged to prove, That the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> holds forth and declares the Covenant, and promiſes thereof, in this latitude and extent, to thoſe awakened Jews, <hi>Acts.</hi> 2.29.</p>
               <p>It is replyed, That there were other Reaſons of his mentioning their Children, then the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerting their right to; and intereſt in the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant and I romiſe thereof. That ſhift (for ſo I ſhall call it) can have no place here, for if it
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:106624:84"/>ſhould be granted, that the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> might mention the Children of theſe Jews, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to that imprecation they were under, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded in <hi>Matth.</hi> 27.25. ir wutg reſpect to that firſt offer and tender of Chriſt and the grace of the Goſpel to be made to the Jews; yet there could be no ſuch reaſon of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle mentioning the Jaylors houſe, they were under no ſuch imprecation, neither had they any priviledge above others, in point of the offers and tenders of Salvation to be made to them; and therefore the only reaſon imaginable of the Apoſtles mentioning of his houſe, was to aſſure him, that upon his believing he ſhould injoy the promiſe of Salvation, in the extent and latitude it was at the firſt eſtabliſhment of the Covenant given unto <hi>Abraham:</hi> had not the promiſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to his houſe, as well as to himſelf, perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally conſidered, there had been no reaſon for the Apoſtle to mention his houſe, and tell him, that not only himſelf, but his houſe ſhould be ſaved, had not a peculiar good redounded to his houſe by his believing: It had been a more ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual motive to have told him, that the whole Town ſhould have been ſaved in as much as then his houſe had been included, and he had had a further intimation of the probability of other of his Friends, Relations and Acquaintance Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</p>
               <p>Secondly, I anſwer, If we compare this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of <hi>Paul</hi> to the Jaylor, with that fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned paſſage of Chriſt concerning <hi>Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheus</hi>
                  <pb n="122" facs="tcp:106624:85"/>his houſe, 'tis evident, the Apoſtle pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poundeth this promiſe, in both branches of it, to him, upon the alone condition of his perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal believing; and his meaning is, that in caſe he himſelf ſhould believe, he and his houſe ſhould be ſaved, that is, as <hi>Peter</hi> (as hath been already obſerved) expounds it, the promiſe of Salvation would be to him and his houſe; and that this is his meaning, appears from that pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel paſſage of Chriſt: Chriſt tells <hi>Zacheus, Salvation was come to his houſe,</hi> upon his own believing, and that upon that very ground, or for that very reaſon, becauſe he now was a Son of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and upon the ſame ground, and for the ſame reaſon, we muſt ſuppoſe that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle makes this promiſe to the Jaylor; the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle is to be underſtood, according to that of Chriſt, it is as if he had ſaid, believe in the Lord Jeſus, and thereby thou wilt become a Son of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and as ſo related to him, ſhall enjoy the promiſes in the ſame exten and latitude in which it was made to him at the firſt eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of it. God will be a God to thee and thy houſe, that is eminently thy Children, which is all one as to the ſence and importance of that promiſe, Salvation ſhall come to thee and thy houſe, or, The promiſe will be to thee and thy Children: all theſe phraſes are of one and the ſame importance and ſignification. So that from all, the truth of this our third Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion evidently appears, and from it, before I proceed to the other, we may infer theſe two things.</p>
               <pb n="123" facs="tcp:106624:85"/>
               <p>Firſt, That it is not at all neceſſary to affirm or prove, that there were any Infants in the Jaylor houſe at this time, in order to the prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, from the Apoſtles making this conditional promiſe to him and his houſe; that the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of the Covenant are given to, and ſetled up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on believing Gentiles, in the ſame latitude and extent that they were given to <hi>Abraham,</hi> at the firſt eſtabliſhment of the Covenant with him; if he had any Infants, the promiſe had belonged to them as part of his houſe; the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe was to him, with reference to his houſe, as a Believer, without conſideration had to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal faith and repentance of any in or of his houſe; hence whoever was to be included in this term <hi>houſe,</hi> had the promiſe appertaining to them, whether capable of believing or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penting or no, and conſequently had appertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to his Infants, in caſe he had had any, they being neceſſarily to be included in this term <hi>houſe;</hi> and ſuppoſe there was no Infants in his houſe at that time, yet in that this was a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, not peculiar and proper to him, but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to all Believers, the promiſe belongs to the Infants in their reſpective houſes. The promiſe appertains to the houſe, by vertue of the Parents believing, as thereby they are ingrafted into <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Family, and become one of his Seed, and hence all that are included in that term <hi>houſe,</hi> have the promiſe appertaining unto them, and conſequently Infants as well as others.</p>
               <pb n="124" facs="tcp:106624:86"/>
               <p>And if it ſhould be ſaid, There might be ſome Children grown up, who might refuſe to accept of the promiſe, as made upon the terms of the Goſpel, and how could the promiſe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertain to them.</p>
               <p>I anſwer, Their caſe would have been the very ſame with the caſe of the Jews, at the firſt preaching of the Goſpel. The promiſe apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd to them, as of the houſes of believing Parents, but their actual refuſal would have, <hi>ipſo facto,</hi> diſanulled that their right and title to the promiſe, and ſo they, by their own ſin, had deprived themſelves of the good pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed.</p>
               <p>Secondly, We may infer, that the Scripture frequently mentioning the perſonal faith and repentance of the houſes, or of any in the hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of believing Parents, no way oppoſes, but on the other hand ſtrongly confirms the truth of what we affirm in this ſecond Propoſition, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the ſettlement of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s promiſe, in the full latitude and extend of it, upon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving Gentiles, in that the houſes, or any in the houſes of believing Parents, were ſavingly wrought upon, either at the ſame time, or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately after their Parents believing and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting the terms of the Covenant, it cannot be with the leaſt ſhew of reaſon inferred or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded from thence, that they had not the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of Salvation appertaining to them, meerly as the houſes, or as of the houſes of ſuch Parents,
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:106624:86"/>without conſideration had to their own per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal faith and repentance; but on the other hand it doth ſtrongly prove, they were under the promiſe, as the houſes of ſuch Parents, in their believing and repenting the Promiſe was verified; their believing and repenting was a viſible demonſtration, that the promiſe, in the extent and latitude before expreſt, <hi>viz.</hi> as reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and taking in the houſes with the Parents themſelves, was duly and rightfully applyed to ſuch Parents by the Apoſtle, when we find the Apoſtle applyes the promiſes of the Covenant to the Gentiles, in the ſame latitude and extent that they were given to <hi>Abraham, viz.</hi> as ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king in their Children with them, and them read of the faith and repentance of their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, immediately following upon their own be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving, it may more fully aſſure us, that the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe runs ſtill in the ſame latitude and extent that it formerly run in: why, we have not only the Apoſtles application of the promiſe for our aſſurance, but we have God himſelf confirming that application made by the Apoſtle, in his giving in the good promiſed, in that extent and latitude in which the Apoſtle did apply the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe: The Apoſtle applyes the promiſe in this extent, <hi>Thou and thy houſe ſhall be ſaved:</hi> God by actually giving in the good promiſed, aſſures us, that the Apoſtles application was according to his mind and will, that he was and would be ſtill a God, not only to believing Gentiles, perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally conſidered, but a God alſo to their reſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive houſes: So that whether there were any
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:106624:87"/>Infant-children, or any Children in their Infant capacity in theſe houſes, the baptiſm of which is recorded in Scripture, or no, is all one as to what I contend for. The promiſe of Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which is equivolently the ſame with that of Gods being a God to them, appertains to the houſes of believing Parents, as ſuch, without conſideration had to the perſonal faith of thoſe houſes, or any in them. If there were no In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant-children, yet the promiſe appertains to the houſe; if there were, the promiſe appertained to them as part of ſuch a houſe: and the men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion made in Scripture of the perſonal faith and repentance of ſuch houſes, or any in them, no way oppoſes, but confirms their intereſt in, and right to that promiſe of Salvation, and conſequently they ought to be baptized, as will appear from the proof of our third Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition.</p>
               <p>But let that ſuffice, for the ſecond Concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which is that I principally aimed at, and therefore have eſpecially inſiſted upon it. I ſhall but mention the other two. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,</p>
               <p>Fourthly, That the intereſt that the houſes of beliving Parents have in the promiſe of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion denominates them holy, and conſtitutes them of the Kingdom, Church, or Myſtical Body of Chriſt; this I gather from <hi>Mark</hi> 10. and 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.14. taken in conjunction with thoſe other new Teſtament Scriptures aforemention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
               <pb n="127" facs="tcp:106624:87"/>
               <p>Laſtly, That this intereſt in the promiſe of Salvation accrews to the houſes of believing Parents, by vertue of ſuch Parents relation to <hi>Abraham,</hi> as his Seed: This is evident from that of Chriſt concerning <hi>Zacheus, Salvation is come to his houſe, for as much as he is a Son of</hi> Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham. And from all it appears, that the very ſame promiſe, made to <hi>Abraham</hi> and his natural Seed, is ſtill continued to, and ſetled upon believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Gentiles, which is our ſecond Propoſition: Let us now hear what is objected againſt what is aſſerted in it.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>Objections againſt the ſecond ſubordinate Propoſition, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered and anſwered.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>Object. <hi>1.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>'TIs conceived by ſome, and that not a few, that what hath been affirm'd in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going Propoſitions, at leaſt the latter of them, lyes in a direct oppoſition to that Text of the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.7, 8. and therefore cannot be true. And thus 'tis objected: How can it be true, that God ſhould intend <hi>Abraham</hi>'s natural Seed (take it of his natural Seed in the ſence of the firſt Poſition) and that as ſuch, in that promiſe, wherein he ingages himſelf to be a God to him and his Seed; or how can it be true, that this promiſe, in that latitude and extent ſhould be given to, and ſetled upon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:106624:88"/>under the new Teſtament; when the Apoſtle, having a direct reference to this very promiſe, poſitively affirms, <hi>That the Children of the fleſh are not the Children of God, but the Children of the Promiſe are accounted for the Seed.</hi> Say our Oppoſers, Certainly it cannot be true that God ſhould intend <hi>Abraham</hi>'s natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Seed, that is, the Children of his fleſh, and that meerly as ſuch, in that promiſe; or ſuppoſe that promiſe might have a literal reſpect to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi>'s natural Seed, as ſuch, yet ſure it cannot be true, that this promiſe is given to, or ſetled upon believers under the new Teſtament, ſo as that God ſhould ſtill ſtand obliged by that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>promiſe, to be a God to them and their natural Seed; for the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> tells us in expreſs words, <hi>That the Children of the fleſh are not the Children of God, but the Children of the promiſe are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted for the Seed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For anſwer to this Objection I ſhall, as the Lord ſhall aſſiſt, do theſe two things,</p>
               <p>Firſt, Shew that there is no contrariety or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnancy, between what hath been affirmed in the foregoing Propoſitions, or either of them, and this Text of the Apoſtle.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Shew that this place of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle rightly underſtood, contributes not a little to the eſtabliſhment and confirmation of what hath been ſaid in the foregoing Propoſitions.</p>
               <pb n="130" facs="tcp:106624:89"/>
               <p>For the firſt, That there is no repugnancy between what hath been affirmed and this Text of the Apoſtle, will ſoon appear, by declaring what is the true and genuine ſenſe of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle in theſe verſes: and thus it is agreed on all hends, that the Apoſtles deſign and ſcope is to open and declare how that word or promiſe, wherein God ingaged to be a God to <hi>Abraham</hi> and his Seed, ſtood firm, and had its full accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment, according to the true intendment of God in it, notwithſtanding the rejection of to great a part of his ſeed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Beza,</hi> I judge, doth reightly ſtate the Queſtion anſwered by the Apoſtle, <hi>Qui fieri poſſit ut re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectus ſit Iſrael quin ſimul conſtituendum videa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur irritum eſſe pactum Dei cum Abrahamo &amp; ejus ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="3 letters">
                        <desc>•••</desc>
                     </gap>ne.</hi> That was the Queſtion, How <hi>Iſrael</hi> could be rejected, and the Covenant that God, made with <hi>Abraham</hi> and his Seed, not made void thereby.</p>
               <p>Now to this Queſtion the Apoſtle anſwers in a twofold general Aſſertion.</p>
               <p>Firſt, That all are not <hi>Iſrael</hi> that are of <hi>Iſrael.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, That becauſe they are the Seed of <hi>Abraham</hi> they are not all Children.</p>
               <pb n="131" facs="tcp:106624:89"/>
               <p>Two things might be urged as Reaſons, why the Jews could not be rejected without a failure on Gods part, in his promiſes to them: The latter, which they mainly inſiſted upon, was, That they were the Seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and that God had promiſed to be a God to him and his Seed after him.</p>
               <p>To this latter plea the Apoſtle anſwers in this latter aſſertion, and ſhews, that their rejection did not make void that promiſe of God, and in order hereunto explains the true ſenſe and meaning of that promiſe.</p>
               <p>This the Apoſtle doth in theſe two verſes; ſo that theſe two verſes contain the Apoſtles expoſition of that grand promiſe made to <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> with reference to his Seed.</p>
               <p>Now that we may rightly underſtand the Apoſtle in the expoſition he gives us of this promiſe, and not miſtake about his expoſition, as the Jews did about the promiſe it ſelf, we muſt inquire into two things.</p>
               <p>Firſt, What the Apoſtle denyes.</p>
               <p>Secondly, What he affirms, with reference to that promiſe.</p>
               <p>For the firſt, And thus the Apoſtle denyes that all that were the Seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and had that promiſe appertaining to them, as his Seed, were the Children of God: Thus verſe 7. <hi>Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther becauſe they are the Seed of Abraham, are
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:106624:90"/>they all Children,</hi> which is explained in the next verſe; where obſerve, when the Apoſtle ſayes, <hi>The children of the fleſh, theſe are not the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God,</hi> he muſt be interpreted by the words immediately aforegoing, and his meaning is, they are not all the children of God, for ſo he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſes himſelf in the foregoing words. In this eighth verſe the Apoſtle amplifies, and further explains what he had more generally laid down in the ſeventh verſe; whence it is evident, that he ſpeaks of the ſame perſons in both; and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerably, as by the children of the fleſh, ver. 8. the ſame perſons are intended that are expreſt by that phraſe, <hi>the Seed of Abraham,</hi> ver 7. ſo when he ſays of the children of the fleſh, <hi>they are not the children of God,</hi> he means only, as he had afore expreſt, they are not all the children of God: ſome that were the children of the fleſh, were alſo the children of God, as <hi>Iſaac</hi> in particular, but all that were the children of the fleſh were not the children of God.</p>
               <p>Now I ſay, the Apoſtle denyes that thoſe that were the Seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> or the children of the fleſh, were all the children of God: where con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering what the general deſign and ſcope of the Apoſtle is, <hi>viz.</hi> to prove the conſiſtency of <hi>Iſraels</hi> rejection with the truth of that promiſe, by opening and declaring the true mind and meaning of God in it, theſe two things are clearly ſuppoſed and implyed by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle.</p>
               <pb n="133" facs="tcp:106624:90"/>
               <p>Firſt, That thoſe who are not the children ot God, whatever reference or reſpect the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe had to them, yet might be rejected with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out breach of promiſe on Gods part.</p>
               <p>Secondly, That the promiſe did not neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily preſuppoſe that God had done, or was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to do, for every one to whom the promiſe did appertain, what was abſolutely neceſſary to their being or becoming the children of God, in ſuch a ſence as that they could not be rejected without breach of promiſe on Gods part.</p>
               <p>Theſe two things the Apoſtle muſt needs im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply and ſuppoſe in this Negation: and hence the full of what he denyes is this, That this promiſe, whether taken as a definite promiſe, reſpecting <hi>Abraham</hi>'s natural Seed, as immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately proceeding from his own loins, ſingularly conſidered, or as an indefinite promiſe, reſpecting his whole race and poſterity, collectively conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, did oblige God, either to be their God and own them as his people, but upon ſuppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their being his children, or to do that for each particular of them, abſolutely neceſſary to their bearing that denomination of his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</p>
               <p>And if any ask, What that is that is abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely neceſſary to a perſons bearing the deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of a Child of God.</p>
               <p>I anſwer two things.</p>
               <pb n="134" facs="tcp:106624:91"/>
               <p>Firſt, Election before time.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Suppoſing that perſon grown up to years of maturity, converſion or a ſaving work of grace upon the heart in time.</p>
               <p>Now all that the Apoſtle denyes is, That this promiſe did neceſſarily preſuppoſe, that all to whom it was made, were elected or choſen of God actually to inherit the good promiſed, or that the promiſe did oblige God ſavingly to work upon them in time; whence in reſpect of individual and particular perſons, as they might not be elected, ſo they might not be ſavingly converted, and thereupon might be rejected of God, without any breach of promiſe on his part.</p>
               <p>Secondly, What the Apoſtle doth affirm with reference to this promiſe; and thus he doth affirm, That <hi>the children of the promiſe are accounted for the Seed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now here again two things muſt be inquired into.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Who the Apoſtle means by the children of the promiſe? And for this, theſe muſt needs be ſuch of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s natural Seed who might rightfully bear that denomination of the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God; children of the promiſe muſt needs intend ſuch of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Seed, or ſuch children of his fleſh, who were not only the children of his fleſh, but alſo the children of
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:106624:91"/>God. For let it be obſerved, that the queſtion was concerning <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Seed, or the children of his fleſh, and that as ſuch having that promiſe pertaining unto them; whence it will undeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably follow, that both thoſe who were not the children of God, and thoſe who were the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of the promiſe, were <hi>Abraham</hi>'s natural Seed, and conſequently, by the children of the promiſe we muſt underſtand the elect of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>'s natural Seed, or ſuch who amongſt them had a ſaving work of grace wrought upon them.</p>
               <p>Secondly, How they are ſaid to be accounted for the Seed? Now for this: They are ſaid by the Apoſtle, to be accounted for the Seed in ſome peculiar and ſpecial ſence, in which the other of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Seed, as contradiſtinguiſhed from them, were not accounted for the Seed: Now that can be only in reſpect of their ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction before time, and their actual injoyment of the good promiſed in time; they cannot be ſaid to be accounted for the Seed in this ſence, as though none but theſe were intended in that promiſe, for the Reaſon before given, <hi>viz.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the queſtion concerning the whole natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and that as they were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended in that promiſe; ſo that they could not be accounted for the Seed, as though they alone were intended in that promiſe; for the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle grants, yea, the very Queſtion he anſwers, doth neceſſarily ſuppoſe others to be intended
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:106624:92"/>in that promiſe beſides them; therefore theſe can be ſaid to be accounted for the Seed only, in the ſence and upon the account beforemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned.</p>
               <p>Form all it is evident, that the Apoſtle doth not deny what <hi>Abraham</hi>'s natural Seed, and that as ſuch, were intended in that grand Promiſe of the Covenant; nor doth he affirm, that the children of the promiſe were only accounted for the Seed, in relation to an intereſt in that promiſe: All that he denyes is, That they are all the children of God: And all that he affirms is, That they, in a peculiar and ſpecial ſence, were accounted for the Seed in the eye of that promiſe: So that the plain and genuine mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Apoſtle is this, as if he ſhould ſay, when God promiſed to be a God to <hi>Abraham</hi> and to his Seed, that doth not preſuppoſe that all his children were elected, or that God was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged by that promiſe ſavingly to work upon every individual of his Seed; whereupon they might be rejected of God, and yet his word of promiſe receive its full accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, there being a certain number choſen of God from eternity, whom in time he ſavingly works upon, and who in that regard were emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently intended as the Seed in that promiſe, and in the accompliſhment of the promiſe to them it is fully verified, according to the true intent, mind and meaning of God in it.</p>
               <pb n="137" facs="tcp:106624:92"/>
               <p>Now then what repugnancy or contrariety is there between what hath been affirmed in the foregoing Propoſitions, or either of them, and this Text of Scripture?</p>
               <p>We affirm, that when God promiſed to <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> to be a God to him and his Seed, he intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his natural Seed as the firſt and next Subjects of this promiſe, and that this promiſe in the ſame latitude and extent is ſetled upon and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed to believing Gentiles: the Apoſtle de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyes it not only ſaith, that all to whom the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe was made are not the children of God, and thereupon might be rejected, and yet the word of promiſe not made void thereby; withall af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming, that there was a certain number in and among this Seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> to whom this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe did appertain, that were elected of God, who never were rejected, but had the promiſe alwayes made good to them, and in that regard had the denomination of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Seed pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarly due to then, and that the promiſe was fully accompliſhed in their injoyment of the good promiſed. Now I ſay, what ſhew of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariety between what we affirm, and what the Apoſtle ſaith?</p>
               <p>Now that this was the true intendment, mind and meaning of God in this promiſe, the Apoſtle proves, by producing a twofold In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, wherein God himſelf declared that to be his ſence and meaning in it.</p>
               <pb n="138" facs="tcp:106624:93"/>
               <p>Firſt, He inſtances in the Subjects of this Promiſe immediately deſcended from <hi>Abraham</hi>'s own loins, theſe were, among others, <hi>Iſhmael</hi> and <hi>Iſaac:</hi> and here the Apoſtle ſhews how God declared his true ſence and meaning in that Promiſe, by his chuſing <hi>Iſaac</hi> actually to inherit the good promiſed, when he paſſed by <hi>Iſhmael,</hi> who thereupon, through his own ſin, was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected of God, and caſt out of Covenant: This peculiar choice of <hi>Iſaac</hi> was ſignified to <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> by promiſe, <hi>At the ſet time will I come, and Sarah ſhall have a Son;</hi> by that Promiſe God did tacitely intimate to <hi>Abraham,</hi> that <hi>Iſaac,</hi> the Son promiſed him by <hi>Sarah,</hi> was the perſon choſen for the actual injoyment of the good promiſed; and this choice of <hi>Iſaac</hi> was a tacite intimation, that <hi>Iſhmael</hi> was paſſed by, and not deſigned to the joynt inheriting of the good promiſed with <hi>Iſaac.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, The Apoſtle inſtances in the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of this Promiſe mediately deſcended from <hi>Abraham,</hi> for look what was the ſence of the Promiſe made to <hi>Abraham,</hi> the ſame was the ſence and meaning of it as made to his Seed; and thus the Apoſtle inſtances in the Children of <hi>Iſaac.</hi> and ſhews again how God did declare what was his mind and meaning in this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, as it was made to <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Seed in their Generations, <hi>viz.</hi> That as thereby he intended not infallibly to ſecure the good promiſed to all <hi>Abraham</hi>'s immediate Children, ſo he intended
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:106624:93"/>not thereby to ſecure the good promiſed to all the Children of his Seed, as included with them in the Promiſe, as made to them in their Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations; this the Lord declared by his choice of <hi>Jacob,</hi> when he paſſed by <hi>Eſau;</hi> which choice was again ſignified to <hi>Iſaac</hi> by promiſe, <hi>The elder ſhall ſerve the younger;</hi> by that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe God ſignified to <hi>Iſaac,</hi> that he had choſen <hi>Jacob</hi> as the perſon that ſhould actually inherit the good promiſed, whereby he intimated his paſſing by of <hi>Eſau.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now upon the warrant of this twoſold in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, the Apoſtle declares the ſence afore given, to be according to the mind and meaning of God in this promiſe; and that this is the true ſence and meaning of the Apoſtles expoſition of this Promiſe, is ſufficiently evident from what hath been already ſaid in the explication of the words, where it hath been proved, that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle cannot be underſtood, as though he denyed that the natural Seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and that as ſuch were intended in that Promiſe; the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion he anſwers being concerning <hi>Abraham</hi>'s natural Seed, and that as ſuch having that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe appertaining to them: and therefore he cannot be ſuppoſed to deny them to be intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Promiſe, the very Queſtion he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers taking it for granted, that they were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended.</p>
               <p>And if any ſhould ſay, It is true, the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion doth ſuppoſe and take for granted, that
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:106624:94"/>the Jews, or the perſons putting it, did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, that the Promiſe did intend <hi>Abraham</hi>'s natural Seed, but that was their miſtake, which the Apoſtle rectifies.</p>
               <p>But to that I anſwer, The whole context ſhews it was otherwiſe; and that the Apoſtle himſelf doth ſuppoſe it, and take it for granted; The Apoſtle doth not anſwer a Queſtion that might be grounded upon a miſtake about the Subjects of that Promiſe, but he anſwers a Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion grounded upon what really was: we ſee he grants ſome to be of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that were not <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and that ſome were that Seed of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> and as ſuch intended in that Promiſe, who yet were not the Children of God; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently he cannot deny <hi>Abraham</hi>'s natural Seed to be intended in that Promiſe, nor affirm the Children of the Promiſe were only account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for the Seed; but that they are ſo accounted in a peculiar and ſpecial ſence before opened. Now I ſay, that the Apoſtle is thus to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, I ſhall indeavour to make out a little further, though what hath been already ſaid might ſuffice to thoſe that will but ſeriouſly weigh things.</p>
               <p>And for this let it be obſerved, that if the Apoſtle doth not reſtrain this term <hi>Seed,</hi> in that Promiſe, only to the Elect, then there is nothing at all ſaid by him in this expoſition he gives us of it; ſo much as in the leaſt intimating that the natural Seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and that as ſuch,
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:106624:94"/>were not intended in that Promiſe. As for what he denyes, with reference to that Promiſe, there is no one word intimating that <hi>Abraham</hi>'s natural Seed were not intended, he only denyes, that all the Seed of <hi>Abraham</hi> were the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God; which might be true, though they were all intended in that Promiſe, as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditionally made and externally declared to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now if ſo be he doth not reſtrain this term <hi>Seed</hi> in this Promiſe only to the Elect, and ſo exclude all others univerſally from being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended in it, the natural Seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and that as ſuch, might be, for ought what the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle hath ſaid, intended in it. And as for what he affirms, though the Elect were in a peculiar and ſpecial ſence intended, yet others might be alſo intended, though not in that peculiar and ſpecial ſence in which they were.</p>
               <p>Now that the Apoſtle doth not expound this term <hi>Seed,</hi> as meant only of the Elect, is evident by theſe three Reaſons.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Becauſe then he ſhould in expreſs words contradict God himſelf, God having declared that he intended ſome in that Promiſe, who were not elected, this is evident in <hi>Deut.</hi> 29. 10, 11, 12, 13. where the Lord tells the people of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> he now entred into, or rather renewed Covenant with them, to fulfil this very Promiſe made to <hi>Abraham,</hi> with reference to his Seed: and certainly he muſt needs refer to this very
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:106624:95"/>Promiſe made to <hi>Abraham,</hi> with reference to his Seed: and certainly he muſt needs refer to this very Promiſe made to <hi>Abraham.</hi> Only to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent miſtakes, and that I may not be ſuppoſed to contradict both the Truth and my ſelf, let it be noted, that I do not ſay they were intended in that Promiſe, ſo as that they had meerly, as of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s natural Race and Poſterity, an actual right to, and intereſt in that Promiſe; but my meaning is only this, That as that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe had an indefinite reſpect to <hi>Abraham</hi>'s whole Race and Poſterity, collectively taken, and as theſe particular perſons, with whom God now renewed his Covenant, were afore appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of God to be ſome of thoſe who ſhould have the benefit of the Promiſe, ſo theſe were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended in it, and anſwerably theſe were intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, not immediately and directly, but conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently as they were foreſeen and fore appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by God, to be the peculiar perſons that ſhould have the Promiſe, as indefinitely made to <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Seed, collectively taken, made good to them. Now who can ſuppoſe that every individual Member, whether Infants or grown Perſons in this Congregation, were elect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or choſen actually to injoy the good promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed? Now if the Apoſtle ſhould reſtrain this Promiſe only to the Elect, he muſt needs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict God in this declaration here made of his mind in it. God declares plainly, he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended ſome not elected; and ſhould the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſay, he intended only the Elect, that
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:106624:95"/>would be a direct contradiction of God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
               <p>Secondly, That the Apoſtle cannot ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound this term <hi>Seed,</hi> as meant only of the Elect, is evident, becauſe at leaſt many per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons intended in that Promiſe might be ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily known to men to be the perſons in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended in it; but now the Elect cannot or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily be known by men, and that at leaſt many intended in this Promiſe might ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily be known to be the perſons intended in it, is evident, becauſe there was a duty in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned, with reference to them; this duty was the application of the Token of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant. Now had the Elect only been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, it had been impoſſible for that duty to be univerſally performed by man, with refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to them.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, This is evident, becauſe the Promiſe did conſtitute ſome of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> who yet were not elected, therefore the Apoſtle cannot be ſuppoſed to reſtrain the term <hi>Seed</hi> only to the Elect.</p>
               <p>But two things will be ſaid by way of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply to what hath been hitherto diſcourſed, for the clearing up the ſence and meaning of the Apoſtle in this expoſition he here gives of that Promiſe.</p>
               <pb n="144" facs="tcp:106624:96"/>
               <p>Firſt, It will be ſaid, That all thoſe that make this Objection do not deny but, ſome do grant, that that proiſe did in ſome ſence intend, and had reſpect to <hi>Abraham</hi>'s natural Seed, and that as ſuch, <hi>viz.</hi> as it was a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of a temporal good, or containing on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a temporal belſſing, that which theſe deny is this, <hi>viz.</hi> That this Promiſe (as a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of ſaving Grace, of Juſtification and Lefe) had reſpect to the natural Seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> as ſuch; and that is the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Apoſtle when he ſayes, <hi>The Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of the Promiſe are accounted for the Seed,</hi> he menas, they any they only are accounted for the Seed, reſpective to that Promiſe, as it was a promiſe of ſaving Grace: The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle grants the Promiſe was made to <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>'s natural Seed, but there ſhews what their miſtake was, that did ſuppoſe the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe would be made void, in caſe the Jews ſhould be rejected, and ſhews this to be thier miſtake, That they ſuppoſed that this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, as it was a Promiſe of ſaving Grace, did appertain to the natural Seed of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> as ſuch.</p>
               <p>Now this miſtake the Apoſtle rectifies, and ſhews, that as ſuch a ſpiritual Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, it did not at all reſpect <hi>Abraham</hi>'s na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Seed, as ſuch, but was made only to the Elect, they only were accounted for the
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:106624:96"/>Seed, reſpective to this Promiſe as ſo under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood.</p>
               <p>To that I anſwer two things.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Let it be obſerved, that the preſent framers of this Objection, in the ſence now expreſſed, do grant, that the Promiſe in ſome ſence did intend <hi>Abraham</hi>'s natural Seed, and that as ſuch; whence it will follow, that if it be evident, that it intended not only a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral, but a ſpiritual good, as made to <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>'s Seed univerfally, as well as to himſelf, of which by and by, then our firſt Propoſition is true by the grant at leaſt of ſome of our Oppoſers, they granting that in a ſence it did intend them.</p>
               <p>But you will ſay, Whatever Argument may be offered, yet the Apoſtle ſhews plainly, that as it was a Promiſe of ſaving Grace, it was made only to the Elect, for ſaith he, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the Promiſe in this ſence, <hi>The Children of the Promiſe are accounted for the Seed,</hi> and we muſt believe the Apoſtle whatever Argument may ſeem to prove the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.</p>
               <p>I anſwer to this.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Conſider the Apoſtle doth no more reſtrain this Promiſe, as a Promiſe of
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:106624:97"/>ſaving Grace to the Elect, than the doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain it to them as a Promiſe of a meer tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral good, if he doth not reſtrain it to them wholly, and in an abſolute ſence, he doth not reſtrain it to them at all; for obſerve it, in caſe he reſtrains it as a ſpiritual Promiſe, and not as a temporal Promiſe, to the Elect, that limited reſtraint muſt be expreſt either in the words themſelves, or inferr'd from the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text or the Apoſtles ſcope in them. For the words themſelves, there is nothing intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting ſuch a limited reſtraint, for ſayes he, <hi>The Children of the fleſh are not the Children of God, but the Children of the Promiſe are accounted for the Seed.</hi> He doth not ſay, the Children of the fleſh are not intended in that Promiſe, as a Promiſe of ſaving Grace So <hi>the Children of the Promiſe are accounted for the Seed;</hi> not are accounted for the Seed, as that Promiſe was a Promiſe of ſaving Grace.</p>
               <p>But it will be ſaid, When he ſayes of <hi>the Children of the fleſh, they are not the Children of God,</hi> 'tis all one as if he had ſaid, they were not intended in that Promiſe, as it is a Promiſe of ſaving Grace.</p>
               <p>To that I anſwer: 'Tis not all one, in as much as 'tis poſſible, that perſons may be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a Promiſe of ſaving Grace, as made con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditionally
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:106624:97"/>to them, and yet not be the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God, in the ſence of the Apoſtle, nor ever become the Children of God in that ſence: So that unleſs it can be proved, that none can be under a Promiſe of ſaving Grace, as conditionally made, or under a Promiſe of ſaving Grace as indefinitely made to ſome ſpecies or ſort of perſons, collective<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly taken, unleſs they are either at preſent the Children of God, or ſhall infallibly become ſo for the future, it cannot be ſaid, 'tis all one to ſay, that for the Apoſtle to deny the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Seed of <hi>Abraham</hi> to be the Chilnten of God, and to deny they are intended in that Promiſe, as a Promiſe of ſaving Grace, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they might be intended in that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, and yet never be the Children of God. Perſons may be under a conditional promiſe, or an indefinite promiſe of ſaving Grace, and yet cannot be from thence denominated in an abſolute ſence to be the Children of God, nor proved thereby, that they ſhould even become ſo; ſo that ſuch a limited re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint of this promiſe to the Elect only, is not in the leaſt intimated in the words them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
               <p>Secondly, For, the context and ſcope of the Apoſtle neither doth infer ſuch a limited reſtraint of the Promiſe to the Elect only, or a neceſſity of putting ſuch conſtruction upon
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:106624:98"/>the words; this is evident from what hath been already ſaid in explaining the ſence and meaning of them: The words, as afore open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as fully agree to and anſwer the Apoſtles deſign and ſcope, as if they were underſtood with a limited reſtraint, they would do, and do as fully anſwer and ſatisfie the Queſtion or Objection he was to anſwer.</p>
               <p>This is ſo plain, that it would be ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous to add any thing more than what hath been already ſaid: So that there is nothing in the words themſelves, or that can be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced from the Context, or the Apoſtles de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign and ſcope in them, to neceſſitate our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding the Apoſtle to intend any ſuch limited reſtraint of this promiſe to the Elect only; if it be not wholly and abſolutely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained to them, it is not reſtrained to them at all, for ought what appears from the Text of the Apoſtle.</p>
               <p>Now our Oppoſers themſelves grant, That in ſome ſence the promiſe was not reſtrained to the Elect, but did intend <hi>Abraham</hi>'s na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Seed, as ſuch, and therefore we may conclude it was not at all reſtrained to them.</p>
               <p>But it will be ſaid ſecondly, That though it be granted, that this promiſe, as intending
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:106624:98"/>both temporal and ſpiritual bleſſings, did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, and was made to <hi>Abraham</hi>'s natural Seed, and that as ſuch, and conſequently that the Covenant did take in <hi>Abraham</hi>'s natural Seed under the firſt Teſtament, as is affirmed in the firſt Propoſition, yet the Apoſtle here ſhews, that now under the Goſpel admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration it ſhould be ſo no longer.</p>
               <p>Now the Children of the fleſh are not the Children of God in any ſence, but the Children of the Promiſe, that is, true Believers are only accounted for <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Seed.</p>
               <p>To that I anſwer, 'Tis evident from the Context, that the Apoſtle ſpeaks not at all of the extent and latitude in which the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant ſhould be made with, or continued to Believers under the New Teſtament, for the Queſtion he is anſwering doth not all im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately and directly concern Believers un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the New Teſtament, but wholly imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately and directly concerns the Jewes. And obſerve it, What an anſwer ſhould the Apoſtle return to the propoſed Queſtion, according to the judgment of thoſe that make this reply.</p>
               <p>The Queſtion was, How could <hi>Iſrael</hi> be rejected, and God remain true to his Word
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:106624:99"/>of promiſe made to <hi>Abraham</hi> their Father, with reference unto them.</p>
               <p>Now what doth the Apoſtle anſwer to this Queſtion?</p>
               <p>Why, according to the Judgment of theſe men he anſwers, That though the Covenant was made with <hi>Abraham</hi> and his natural Seed, yet now it is only made with Believers themſelves, and extends not to their natural Seed, as it did during the firſt Teſtament ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration.</p>
               <p>And what had that been to the purpoſe, not only the Jewiſh Infants, but the Parents themſelves were rejected.</p>
               <p>I, you will ſay, That Parents were caſt off as well as their Seed is granted, yea, that is the very deſign of the Apoſtle to ſhew, that now under the Goſpel adiminiſtration the Jews themſelves, though <hi>Abraham</hi>'s natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Seed, could no longer continue the people of God, upon the account of their fleſhly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcent from <hi>Abraham,</hi> unleſs they did perſonal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly believe themſelves, and they not believing, both they and their Children were rejected from thoſe priviledges they had hitherto in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed, upon the account of their natural de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcent from <hi>Abraham.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="151" facs="tcp:106624:99"/>
               <p>To this I anſwer two things.</p>
               <p>Firſt, I deny that the Jews had their Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant ſtate and relation, and conſequently their abiding, in the Houſe or Family of God continued to them hitherto, upon the account of their natural deſcent from <hi>Abraham,</hi> as hath been already declared, and might be further manifeſted if needful: Hence this could not be the deſign of the Apoſtle, to ſhew the ceſſation of that privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, becauſe there was no ſuch priviledge heretofore vouchſafed to them, the promiſe conſidered as a definite promiſe, did not extend beyond <hi>Abraham</hi>'s natural Seed, immediately proceeding from his own loins.</p>
               <p>Secondly, I anſwer, That that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, as an indefinite promiſe made to <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> with reference to his natural Seed, taken collectively, doth ſtill appertain to the Jews, notwithſtanding the rejection of ſo great a part of them: This the Apoſtle grants in this diſcourſe, and ſhews how it had in part its accompliſhment in the non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rejection of many of them, and ſhall have its full accompliſhment in the general con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of that Nation in the Ages yet to come. See <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.1, 16, 25. So that this cannot be the meaning of the Apoſtle, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:106624:100"/>their preſent ſtanding in their Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant-relation with God, from which they were now cut off, was not upon the meer account of their natural deſcent from <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> and the Promiſe, according to the true intent of God in it, doth ſtill apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to them, notwithſtanding their rejecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, therefore we muſt neceſſarily underſtand the Apoſtle, according to the ſence and mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing afore given.</p>
               <p>I come now to the ſecond thing promiſed, and that is to ſhew, that this Text of the Apoſtle rightly underſtood, and taken in conjunction with the Context, is ſo far from carrying any contrariety to what hath been affirm'd that it adds not a little to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of it. Yea, I dare boldly ſay, that had there been no other Scriptures to prove the truth of it, my firſt Propoſition would be, paſt all rational contradiction, eſtabliſhed from this very Text; and my ſecond Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition may receive no little confirmation from it.</p>
               <p>For let it be obſerved, the Apoſtle doth plainly grant, yea, implicitly aſſert, that ſome were the Seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and that as ſuch, were the Subjects of that promiſe, who yet were not the Children of God, and in that
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:106624:100"/>regard were not accounted for the Seed, whence it is evident, that the ſame perſons might be the Seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and as ſuch intended in that promiſe, and yet in another ſence were not acounted for the Seed: they were his Seed, that is, the Seed of his fleſh, or his natural Seed, and as ſuch had the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe appertaining to them; but they were not the Children of God, and in that regard not accounted for the Seed, that is, not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended in this promiſe, as the perſons de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned from eternity, actually to injoy the good promiſed; and that notwithſtanding according to the Apoſtles intendment in this term <hi>Seed,</hi> they were not accounted for the Seed, yet they were the fleſhly Seed of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> and as ſuch intended in that promiſe, as the joynt Subjects of it, with others, here ſaid by the Apoſtle, in a ſpecial ſence, to be accounted for the Seed, is part all rational doubt evident from the Apoſtles anſwer to the forementioned Queſtion, taken in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction with the Inſtances produced by him, for the proof of what he aſſerts in that Anſwer.</p>
               <p>Let but the words be carefully ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved: Saith the Apoſtle, <hi>Neither becauſe they are Abraham's Seed, are they all Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,</hi> that is, the Children of God: Whence it is evident, that ſome are the Seed of
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:106624:101"/>
                  <hi>Abraham,</hi> who were not the Children of Gods, and that when the Apoſtle grants, ſome were the Seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> who were not the Children of God, his meaning is, that they had, as the Seed, or natural Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of <hi>Abraham,</hi> this promiſe appertaining unto them, is evident.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Becauſe the Queſtion he was to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer wholly concern'd the natural Seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and that as ſuch, having that pro"miſe appertaining unto them, as before ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved: hence undoubtedly when in way of anſwer to this Queſtion he faith, becauſe they are the Seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> they are not all the Children of God, he muſt needs ſpeak of the ſame perſons that the Queſtion doth concern, otherwiſe his anſwer had been no wayes pertinent to the Queſtion.</p>
               <p>Secondly, This is evident from the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances that the Apoſtle produces to prove what he had aſſerted in this anſwer; and thus he inſtance in <hi>Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> and ſhews how they were elected, and in that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard accounted for the Seed; where the Apoſtle muſt needs have reference to ſome others coming in competition with them, in regard of their ſtanding in a like capacity re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective to the promiſe as externally made and declar'd to <hi>Abraham:</hi> plainly thus the
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:106624:101"/>Apoſtle muſt needs have reference to ſome others who were <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Seed, and as ſcuh had a common external right to, and intereſt in the promiſes with <hi>Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob;</hi> and theſe were <hi>Iſhmael</hi> and <hi>Eſau;</hi> did not the Apoſtle ſuppoſe and grant, that they ſtood in the like capacity, reſpective to theſe promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, as externally made and declared to <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> with <hi>Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> the producing of theſe two Inſtance had made nothing to his purpoſe, nor had been any proof of what he had before aſſerted, in way of anſwer to the Queſtion propoſed; for the Apoſtle to aſſert, that all that are <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Seed are not the Children of God, and that by way of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to the forementioned Queſtion, and then only to declare how <hi>Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> the one of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Seed, immediately proceeding from his one loins, the others of his Race and Poſterity, were intended in this promiſe, as made to <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Seed in their Generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as being elected, and not to ſuppoſe and grant, that there were ſome others, who were alike, either of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s immediate Seed, or of his Race and Poſterity, intended in this promiſe, who were not elect, had made no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all to his preſent purpoſe, but would indeed have evidenced the quite contrary to what he affirms. Whence it appears, in as full evidence as though written with the beams of the Sun, that the Apoſtle doth
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:106624:102"/>grant, the both <hi>Iſhmael</hi> and <hi>Eſau</hi> were the Subjects of this promiſe, the one as one of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Children, immediately proceeding from his own loins, the other included in the promiſe, as made to <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Seed in their Generations, and conſequently that the promiſe did belong to <hi>Abraham</hi>'s natural Seed, as ſuch, which undoubtedly eſtabliſhes the truth of my firſt Propoſition, and no way oppoſes, but rather confirms the ſecond.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>A ſecond, third, and fourth Objection, againſt the foregoing Propoſition re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>felled.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>Object. <hi>2.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>SOme object, That the Promiſe, wherein God ingaged to be a God to <hi>Abraham</hi> and his Seed, cannot in that latitude and extent be ſetled upon and confirmed to believing Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, becauſe that Covenant Believers are now under, is a Covenant wholly divers from that eſtabliſhed with <hi>Abraham;</hi> and when the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venants are divers, the good covenanted cannot be one and the ſame, at leaſt the Subjects of the one cannot lay claim to the good of the other, by vertue of that Covenant they are under: hence a Believer, as a Believer, that is, as <hi>Abraham</hi>'s ſpiritual Seed, could not lay claim to the old Covenant-promiſes, if not deſcended from <hi>Abraham</hi> by <hi>Iſaac</hi> after the fleſh; ſo a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers fleſhly ſeed, take it either of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> or any other Believer, cannot lay claim to the New Covenant Promiſes, unleſs
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:106624:103"/>born again, and engraffed into Chriſt by Faith.</p>
               <p>Now before I return a direct Anſwer to this Objection, I ſhall a little enquire what are the true Notions and Conceptions of the perſons framing it, about that Covenant entred by God with <hi>Abraham</hi> and his Seed in their generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that ſo rightly underſtanding their ſence and apprehenſions of that Covenant, I may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn a more full and direct anſwer to what is objected. And thus, for ought I can yet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, etiher by the moſt ſerious peruſal of their Writings, or by what I can gather from their words, they expreſs and declare their No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Conceptions, we are now enquiring after; one of theſe two wayes.</p>
               <p>Firſt, That God made a twofold Covenant with <hi>Abraham,</hi> the one a Covenant of Grace, the other a legal or temporal Covenant, and that the Covenant of Grace was made with him, and his ſpiritual Seed, <hi>viz.</hi> Believers, whether Jews or Gentiles, without any reſpect at all to a fleſhly deſcent, either from <hi>Abraham</hi> himſelf, or from any of his Seed.</p>
               <p>Secondly, That the legal or temporal Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant was made with <hi>Abraham</hi> and his fleſhly Seed, and only with them, and that as continued in the line of <hi>Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> and that this was the Covenant, the Jews, during the firſt Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment adminiſtration, were under, and the only
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:106624:103"/>Covenant they were under, as the fleſhly Seed of <hi>Abraham.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, Others declare their ſence and conception thus, That there was but one Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant made with <hi>Abraham,</hi> and that was a mixt Covenant, conſiſting partly of ſpiritual, and partly of temporal Promiſes, and as this Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant was a mixt Covenant, ſo anſwerably the Seed of <hi>Abraham</hi> muſt be diſtinguiſhed off. There was, ſay they, his natural Seed, and there was and is his ſpiritual Seed, Now theſe hold that the Covenant, as conſiſting of temporal, or as ſome expreſs it, domeſtick or politick bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings, was made with <hi>Abraham,</hi> and his natural or fleſhly Seed in their generations; but the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, as conſiſting of ſpiritual bleſſings, was made with <hi>Abraham</hi> only, as a ſpiritual Father, and with his ſpiritual Seed, that is, Believers, whether Jews or Gentiles. Now though our Oppoſites do thus variouſly expreſs themſelves, yet they all agree in the general, that only tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral bleſſings did appertain to <hi>Abraham</hi>'s natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Seed, as ſuch, and that ſpiritual bleſſings were wholly or alone promiſed to <hi>Abraham,</hi> in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to his ſpiritual or myſtical Seed; and ſome add, that the Covenant, as conſiſting of tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral bleſſings, was a typical Covenant, <hi>viz.</hi> a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant typifying the Goſpel Covenant, under which Believers now are; though how to make ſence of that notion, eſpecially themſelves grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Covenant of Grace was not eſtabliſhed with <hi>Abraham,</hi> with reference to himſelf and
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:106624:104"/>his ſpiritual Seed, will, I judge, be a matter of no little difficulty; but I ſhall leave it to the perſons concerned in it, if any ſuch yet there be. And thus I have given a brief, yet, I ſuppoſe, a full account of the Notions and Conceptions of our Objectors, about the Covenant now eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed with <hi>Abraham</hi> and his Seed in their ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations, and come now to anſwer the Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons propoſed: And for anſwer to it I ſhall do theſe two things.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Prove that there is no ſuch real and ſpecificla difference between theſe two Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants, as the Objectors ſuppoſe, and take for granted that there is.</p>
               <p>Seconly, Shew that notwithſtanding the Covenant made with <hi>Abraham,</hi> and that made with Believers, ſhould be really and ſpecifically divers the one from the other, yet upon ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal of the truth of what cannot be gainſaid by our Oppoſers, unleſs they ſhall in expreſs terms contradict the Apoſtle, the ſecond Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition may be true.</p>
               <p>Firſt, For the firſt of theſe I ſhall do two things.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Prove that this Covenant, that God entred with <hi>Abraham,</hi> and his Seed in their generations, was a Covenant of Grace, and in particular, that this Promiſe of that Covenant, wherein God engaged himſelf to be a God to him and his Seed, was a Promiſe of a ſpiritual
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:106624:104" rendition="simple:additions"/>bleſſing a good tranſcending any temporal good whatſoever.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Prove that this Covenant, now eſtabliſhed with <hi>Abraham,</hi> is the ſelf ſame Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, for the ſubſtance of it, made with Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers under the New Teſtament.</p>
               <p>For the firſt of theſe I need ſay but little, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe others have ſaid ſo much: See Dr. <hi>Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> in his <hi>Treatiſe of Infant-Baptiſm,</hi> as alſo Mr. <hi>Ball</hi> upon the <hi>Covenant,</hi> Mr. <hi>Warren</hi> and others; and therefore in brief take only theſe three or four Arguments.</p>
               <p>The firſt Argument, If that Covenant, as eſtabliſhed with <hi>Abraham</hi> and his natural Seed, was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> only a temporal or legal Covenant, or the Promiſes appertaining to his natural Seed, were only temporal Promiſes, then many thouſands, who were the actual Subjects of that Covenant, and the Promiſes thereof, might and did never enjoy and benefit by it, and that meerly through Gods not performing what himſelf had promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, without any default on their own or their Parents part: But none, who are the actual Subjects of the Covenant and Promiſes thereof, ever did or could fall ſhort of the good cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanted, meerly through Gods not performing what he had covenanted and promiſed without a default either of the partie themſelves, or of their Parents; Therefore this Covenant, as eſtabliſhed with <hi>Abraham</hi> and his natural Seed,
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:106624:105"/>could not be a meer temporal or legal Covenant, or a Covenant conſiſting only of temporal bleſſings, but muſt needs be a Covenant of Grace, or a Covenant conſiſting of ſaving benefits and bleſſings.</p>
               <p>For the conſequence in the Major Propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that cannot be denied, in as much as many thouſands, who were the actual Subjects of this Covenant and the Promiſes thereof, whether they were ſo, as they were <hi>Abraham</hi>'s imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate natural Seed, or were ſo, as included with their Covenant-parents, in that phraſe, in their generations, might and did die in their infancy, before ever they came to reap and injoy any temporal benefit, by that Covenant or the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes thereof. Now this could ariſe from no other head or ſpring, but only Gods not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming to them what he had promiſed: And if it ſhould be ſaid, Though God did deny to give them in that very temporal good contained in the Promiſes of that Covenant, yet they were infallibly ſaved, and ſo had only an exchange of a temporal good for a ſpiritual; though they had not that particular good covenanted, yet they had a better good, <hi>viz.</hi> the good of eternal life.</p>
               <p>But to that I anſwer two things:</p>
               <p>Firſt, Grant it be ſo; yet they never had any benefit by this Covenant, or the Promiſes of it, the actual Subjects of which yet they were, neither could they enjoy eternal life by vertue of that Covenant or any Promiſes of it, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:106624:105"/>to the judgment of our Oppoſers, in as much as it was, according to their judgment, only a temporal Covenant.</p>
               <p>But ſome will ſay, Though they had not ſalvation by vertue of this Covenant, yet all Infants dying in their infancy, before they commit any actual ſin, are infallibly ſaved, and conſequently thoſe whoſe caſe falls under our preſent conſideration were ſaved.</p>
               <p>I anſwer, Suppoſe it ſhould be ſo yet.</p>
               <p>Secondly, I ſay, That many thouſands might live to commit actual ſin, and yet die before they come to enjoy any benefit by this Covenant and the Promiſes thereof, ſuppoſing it be only a legal or temporal Covenant, and conſequently might not only be deprived of any benefit by this Covenant, meerly through Gods not performing what he had promiſed to them, but might through their own ſin fall ſhort of any higher good, which may be ſuppoſed ſhould have been given in lieu of the good of this Covenant. But now for any to fall wholly ſhort of that good promiſed to them, eſpecially when nothing is given in lieu thereof, meerly through Gods not performing what he had promiſed to them, is inconſiſtent with the truth and faithfulneſs of God, who hath ſtiled himſelf, A God keeping Covenant and mercy for ever; and therefore this Covenant could not, as made to <hi>Abraham</hi>'s natural Seed, be a meer temporal Covenant, promiſing only a temporal good, but muſt needs be a Covenant of Grace, conſiſting of
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:106624:106"/>ſpiritual Promiſes, as Juſtification, Adoption, the in-dwelling preſence of the Spirit, Life and Glory, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, If God ingaged himſelf to be a God to <hi>Abraham</hi>'s natural Seed by this Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant and the Promiſes thereof, and to have God engaged by Covenant to a people to be their God, be a greater and more excellent good, than it is to enjoy any meer temporal good whatever, then this Covenant was made with <hi>Abraham's</hi> natural Seed, as ſuch, was not a meer temporal Covenant, nor the Promiſes of it, Promiſes of meer temporal bleſſings: But the Covenant was a Covenant of Grace, and the Promiſes of it Promiſes of ſpiritual bleſſings. But the former is true, therefore the latter.</p>
               <p>The Conſequence in the Major propoſition is undeniable, unleſs any ſhall affirm, that there may be a good, greater and more excellent, than any temporal good can poſſibly be, which yet is no ſpiritual good, or which may be given to men no way intereſſed in the Covenant of Grace; if any ſuch good can be found out, that excels any temporal good whatſoever, and yet is not a ſaving good, hath no reference and relation to the ſalvation of thoſe that enjoy it, they will do ſomething to the invalidating this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; till then I ſhall take it for granted, that no ſuch good is imaginable.</p>
               <p>And for the Minor propoſition, that is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently evident from that, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.7. compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with <hi>Pſalm</hi> 144. and the latter end: We
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:106624:106"/>ſee from this <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. that God did ingage him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, by the Promiſe of this Covenant, to be a God to <hi>Abraham</hi>'s natural Seed, as ſuch, <hi>I will be a God to thee and thy Seed;</hi> which Promiſe, as hath been proved, reſpects his natural Seed, as ſuch, as the immediate and next Subjects of it; beſides, according to the judgment of our Oppoſers, the Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> was given to all <hi>Abraham's</hi> natural Seed, immediately deſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from him by <hi>Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> ſetting aſide <hi>Eſau</hi> and his poſterity, as the proper and ſpecial good intended in this Covenant, as reſpecting them. Now we ſee plainly, as words can make any thing plain in the world, God ingages by promiſe, not only to give them that Land, but to be a God unto them, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.8. And that to have God engaged by Covenant, to be a God to any people, is a greater and more excellent good, than any meer temporal good, is evident from that paſſage of the Pſalmiſt, where, we ſee, he plainly prefers this good above any temporal good whatſoever; for having ſpoken of their happineſs, who have the enjoyment of temporal mercies and bleſſings, he adds, as preferring this above all, <hi>Yea, happy is that people, whoſe God is Jehovah.</hi> Now how could the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> prefer an intereſt in God above the enjoyment of all worldly felicity, in caſe it was but a temporal good it ſelf, or a good that only referred to mans temporal happineſs and felicity, or had no refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to any higher happineſs than the things of the world have? Yea let me ſay, did this Promiſe import only a temporal good, their
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:106624:107"/>happineſs, who had God, as their God, by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of it, according to the terms upon which it was now given, their happineſs, I ſay, had been rather leſs than greater than the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of thoſe, whoſe portion wholly lyes in the things of the world; ſo that the Pſalmiſt might better have prefixed this <hi>yea</hi> to the happineſs of others, than to their happineſs, whoſe God is the Lord, and might have ſaid, Happy is the people whoſe God is the Lord, yea, happy is the people who is in ſuch a caſe, in reſpect of worldly proſperity, as is before expreſſed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> But it may be ſome will ſay, This having the Lord engaged to be a peoples God, of which the Pſalmiſt ſpeaks, is meant of their having him engaged as their God by the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace, and not of their having him en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged, as their God, by the Covenant made with <hi>Abraham</hi> and his natural Seed, and ſo it is granted, that to have a covenant-intereſt in God, is a good, vaſtly greater and more excellent, than any temporal good whatſoever.</p>
               <p>But to that I anſwer, The Pſalmiſt ſpeaks of a covenant intereſt abſolutely, without diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing of the Covenant conveying that inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, and where the Scripture doth not diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh, we ought not; and conſequently the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture preferring a covenant-intereſt in God above all outward and worldly felicity whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, we may and ought to conclude, there is no covenant-intereſt, but what doth ſo vaſtly
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:106624:107"/>excel any temporal good whatſoever; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently, that the intereſt the natural Seed of <hi>Abraham</hi> had in God, was a good tranſcending any temporal good, and anſwerably muſt needs be a ſpiritual good; whence it will undeniably follow, that this Covenant conveying this inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt in God unto them, was a Covenant of Grace, and that this promiſe was a promiſe of a ſpiritual and ſaving good.</p>
               <p>Third Argument, If that Promiſe of the Covenant entred with <hi>Abraham</hi> and his natural Seed, as ſuch, which according to the letter and outward face of the words, did intend and point to a meer temporal good, did yet, according to a more inward ſence and meaning of the Holy Ghoſt in it, intend a ſpiritual good, typified by that temporal good, then that Promiſe, which according to the letter and outward face of the words, did intend and point to a ſpiritual good, muſt needs be underſtood of that ſpiritual good, which, according to the letter and outward face of the words, it did intend and point to, and conſequently that Covenant muſt needs be a Covenant of ſpiritual bleſſings: but the former is true, therefore the latter. For the Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence in the Major Propoſition of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſyllogiſm, I ſuuppoſe, it will not be denied by any that are Maſters of their own Reaſon, if that promiſe of the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> which in the letter, and according to the outward face of the words, intended only a temporal good, (for <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan,</hi> according to the letter, was but a tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:106624:108"/>good.) Now if that Promiſe, according to a more inward ſence of the Holy Ghoſt, intended a ſpiritual good, ſurely that Promiſe, of Gods being a God, which in the letter, and according to the outward face of the word, intends a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual good, muſt needs be underſtood of that good it did in the letter and outward face of the words intend; and for the antecedent, that I ſuppoſe will be denied, <hi>viz.</hi> that that promiſe of <hi>Canaan</hi> did, according to a more inward ſence of the Holy Ghoſt, intend and point to a ſpiritual good; but this is ſo evident, that it doth indeed admit of no contradiction, from thoſe who will not profeſſedly ſet themſelves to oppoſe the Scriptures: See <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.9, 10. <hi>He looked for a City, whoſe Maker and Builder is God.</hi> By what warrant did he look for this City? Doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs by the warrant of this Promiſe of the Land of <hi>Canaan;</hi> but for this ſee Mr. <hi>Carter,</hi> in his <hi>Abraham</hi>'s <hi>Covenant opened,</hi> page 23, 43. See alſo Mr. <hi>Tombs</hi> his <hi>Exercitation,</hi> page 2. Now then both parts of the Proſyllogiſm being true, it will undeniably follow, that this Covenant, as made with <hi>Abraham</hi> and his natural ſeed, was a Covenant of Grace, or did conſiſt of ſpiritual Promiſes; and in particular, that that Promiſe, wherein God ingaged himſelf to be a God to <hi>Abraham</hi> and his Seed, was a Promiſe of ſaving Grace.</p>
               <p>The fourth Argument, That this Promiſe of the Covenant in particular, wherein God inga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged himſelf to be a God to <hi>Abraham</hi> and his
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:106624:108"/>Seed, as it did reſpect his natural Seed, as ſuch, did intend and import a ſpiritual good, or was a Promiſe, as ſome ſpeak, of ſaving Grace, that is, did intend ſuch a ſpiritual bleſſing, as had a direct reference to future ſalvation: I prove thus, <hi>viz.</hi> Becauſe it did, as it doth reſpect, or was made to <hi>Abraham</hi>'s myſtical Seed, intend, as is confeſſed by all, a ſpiritual good, whence we argue; If all Promiſes made in the ſame words, terms, and expreſſions to divers perſons ſeverally and particularly conſidered, do alwayes ſignifie and intend one and the ſame good, as made to one, that they do as made to another, unleſs God himſelf hath ſome where or ſome way declared his ſence and meaning in them to be divers, as made to one, from what it is as made to another, and this Promiſe in particular be made in the ſame words, terms and expreſſions to <hi>Abraham</hi>'s natural Seed, that is is as made to his myſtical Seed, and God hath no where or no way decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red his ſence and meaning in it, as made to his natural Seed, to be divers from what it is, as made to his myſtical Seed, then it muſt needs intend and ſignifie one and the ſame good, as made to the one; that it doth as made to the other, and conſequently it ſignifying and intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a ſpiritual good, as made to his myſtical Seed, muſt needs intend a ſpiritual good as made to his natural Seed: But the former is true, therefore the latter; That the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe was made to <hi>Abraham</hi>'s whole Seed, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther natural, taking that phraſe in the ſenſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore opened, or myſtical, hath been ſufficiently
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:106624:109"/>proved already; and that it did intend a ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual good, or was a promiſe of ſaving Grace, as made to his myſtical Seed, is not denied by our Oppoſers. Now let it be either ſhewed where or by what way God hath declared his ſence and meaning in it, as it was made to <hi>Abraham</hi>'s natural Seed, to be diverſe from what it is, as made to his myſtical Seed, or let it be proved, that the Promiſe made, as before expreſſed, may carry a ſence and ſignification, as made to one, different from what it doth as made to another: This latter, I judge, will not be attempted, the attempting of it will be but an attempt to raze the foundation of all the comfort of Chriſtians, and whether God hath any where or any way declared his ſence and meaning in it, as made to <hi>Abraham</hi>'s natural Seed, to be diverſe from what it is, as made to his myſtical, ſhall be conſidered by and by; in the mean time we may evidently ſee, that this Covenant, as made with <hi>Abraham</hi>'s natural Seed, and that as ſuch was a Covenant of Grace, or did conſiſt of Promiſes of ſpiritual and ſaving bleſſings; and from what hath been ſaid, it evidently appears, there is no ſuch real and ſpecifical difference between that Covenant made with <hi>Abraham,</hi> and that Believers are under, as this Objection doth ſuppoſe and take for granted; it evidently appears, they are not ſpecifically two Covenants, but <hi>quoad ſubſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am,</hi> one and the ſame: Now the foundation of this Objection being removed, the Objection falls to the ground, and hath no weight in it.</p>
               <pb n="191" facs="tcp:106624:109"/>
               <p>Secondly, That this Covenant now made with <hi>Abraham</hi> and his Seed, is one and the ſame for ſubſtance that Believers, under the Goſpel adminiſtration are under: This I evidence by theſe two Arguments.</p>
               <p>Firſt, If this Covenant made with <hi>Abraham</hi> and his Seed was not diſanulled, either by the Law, or by or together with any change or al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration God hath made in his adminiſtrations, with reference to his Church in after times, then it was never diſanulled, but is ſtill in being, and conſequently the ſame in ſubſtance with that Covenant, according unto which God doth diſpence and give out his ſaving mercies and bleſſings to believing Gentiles in the times of the Goſpel: but the former is true, therefore the latter. Certainly it cannot be denied, but that this Covenant is ſtill in being and in force, yea, is that very Convenant, according to which God doth diſpence his bleſſings and mercies to believing Gentiles in the times of the Goſpel, in caſe it was never diſanulled, unleſſs any ſhall ſay, there is a twofold Covenant of Grace ſtill in being, one a temporal Covenant, another a ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Covenant, which is not affirmed by any that I have yet heard of, or met with, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the conſequence in the Major propoſition will not, I judge, be queſtioned by any: For the Minor propoſition, <hi>viz.</hi> That this Covenant made with <hi>Abraham</hi> and his Seed, was yet never diſan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>ed <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> abrogated, is expreſly declared by the Appliſt, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.17. <hi>This I ſay, Brethren,
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:106624:110"/>that the Covenant which was confirmed of God in Chriſt, the Law which was four hundred and thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty years after, cannot diſanul, that it ſhould make the Promiſe of none effect.</hi> What Covenant the Apoſtle here intends is ſufficiently evident, as from the foregoing verſe, ſo from the whole context, <hi>viz.</hi> That Covenant made with <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> and his Seed in their generations, as hath been before proved. Now ſaith the Apoſtle of this Covenant, the Law which was given four hundred and thirty years after the eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment of it, could not diſanual it; and let it be diligently obſerved, that in caſe this Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant had been diſanulled either at, or any time before the coming of faith, as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, that is, at the laying aſide the Moſaical Pedago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, and the ſetting up the Goſpel adminiſtration in the room thereof (and from that time ſince, ſure none will pretend it hath been diſanulled) it had been all one as to the deſign of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, as if it had been diſanulled by the Law, had it been diſanulled at the ſetting up, yea, or were to have been diſanulled during the diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation of the Goſpel, under which we are: The Apoſtle could no more have proved, that the bleſſing of <hi>Abraham</hi> was come upon the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles through Chriſt, as believed in, from the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of that Covenant, as we ſee he doth, then if it had been diſanulled by the Law, for if it had not been diſanulled by the Law, yet if it had been diſanulled at, or conſequent to the ſetting up of the Goſpel adminiſtration, the tenour of that Covenant had no way proved
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:106624:110"/>what the Apoſtle deſigned the proof of: To what purpoſe ſhould the Apoſtle have produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced the tenour of that Covenant, to prove the neceſſity of the Gentiles incorporation into Chriſt, in order to their enjoying the bleſſing of <hi>Abraham,</hi> had it been now diſanulled, in caſe it had not been diſanulled by the Law, ſo that it is paſt all doubt, that that Covenant was not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anulled, when the Apoſtle wrote to the <hi>Galati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> nor was to be diſanulled, during the Goſpel adminiſtration we are now under, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently there being but one Covenant, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to which the benefits and bleſſings of the Goſpel, are diſpenſed unto Gentile Believers, it muſt needs be this very Covenant afore made with <hi>Abraham,</hi> and his Seed in their Generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which is the thing to be proved.</p>
               <p>Secondly, If believing Gentiles enjoy the ſaving bleſſings and benefits of the Goſpel, as the Seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> by vertue of that ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Promiſe of the Covenant made with <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham,</hi> and his Seed in their generations, then the Covenant made with him and his Seed is one and the ſame for ſubſtance with that Covenant, believers are ſtill under; but the former is true, therefore the latter: It is mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellous how it can enter into the heart of any man, that is maſter of his own underſtanding, to imagine, that there ſhould be a real and ſpecifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal difference, between that Covenant made with <hi>Abraham,</hi> and the Covenant Believers are now
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:106624:111"/>under, when it is by vertue of the fundamental promiſe of that Covenant made with <hi>Abraham,</hi> that they enjoy all the good of the Goſpel, or all the ſaving good they are by Chriſt made par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of: Can they be under one Covenant, and yet enjoy all the good they do enjoy by Chriſt, by vertue of another Covenant, really and ſpecifically divers from that they are under, and which is long ſince diſanulled and abroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted? To affirm it it would be an abſolute contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction: And that they do enjoy all the good they have by Chriſt, as they are <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Seed, by vertue of this very Promiſe of that Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant made with <hi>Abraham,</hi> is ſo evident throughout this whole diſcourſe of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, that it needs no other proof, than the bare reciting of his words, ſee <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.29. <hi>If ye are Chriſts, then are ye Abraham's Seed, and Heirs according to Promiſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But it may be ſome will yet object, Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, not withſtanding all that hath been ſaid, there muſt needs be a real and ſpecifical difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Covenant that the Jews were under, during the firſt Teſtament adminiſtration, and the Covenant that Believers are under, during the new TeſTament adminiſtration; for doth not the Scripture expreſly call them two Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venants? doth not the new Teſtament fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently ſpeak of a new Covenant that Believers are now under, in a contradiſtinction from the old.</p>
               <pb n="195" facs="tcp:106624:111"/>
               <p>To that I anſwer, That when the Scripture ſpeaks of two Covenants, or ſpeaks of a new Covenant eſtabliſhed with Believers under the new Teſtament, it alwayes hath reference to that Covenant, made with the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> at Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> and never hath reference to this Covenant made with <hi>Abraham;</hi> the words are as plain as words can be expreſſed, ſee <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. latter end, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.8. Yea, the Scripture is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs that the new Covenant is the ſame that was firſt entred with <hi>Abraham;</hi> So that, I ſay, the Covenant of Grace we are now under, is not another Covenant, ſpecifically different from this made with <hi>Abraham,</hi> but they are for the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance one and the ſame; and hence this Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction not only vaniſheth, but we have an addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional confirmation of the truth of what is af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed in our ſecond Propoſition; and we might add,</p>
               <p n="5">5. A fifth Argument thus, If the Covenant be one and the ſame, then the Promiſes of it muſt, unleſs limited by God himſelf, run in one and the ſame extent and latitude; but the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant is one and the ſame, and the Promiſes are not limited by God himſelf; therefore they muſt run in one and the ſame extent and lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude: But the truth aſſerted is ſufficiently evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, therefore I need not inlarge upon it.</p>
               <p>In ſhall come to the ſecond thing propoſed in anſwer to this Objection.</p>
               <pb n="196" facs="tcp:106624:112"/>
               <p>Secondly, NotwithſTanding the Covenant made with <hi>Abraham,</hi> and that made with Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, ſhould be really and ſpecifically diverſe the one from the other, yet upon the ſuppoſal of the truth of what cannot be gainſaid by our Oppoſers, unleſs they ſhall in expreſs terms con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict the Apoſtle himſelf, this ſecond Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition may be true, and conſequently the aſſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and maintaining, that the Promiſe made to <hi>Abraham,</hi> in that latitude and extent, as to take in his natural Seed, as joynt Subjects with him of the ſame Promiſe, is given to and ſetled upon believing Gentiles, in the ſame extent and lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, doth not neceſſarily require the aſſerting and maintaining the Covenant entred with him, and the Covenant entred with Believers, to be one and the ſame Covenant: for the clearing up and evidencing of this, let it be obſerved, that the Apoſtle doth in expreſs words affirm, That if the Gentiles are Chriſts, they are <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>'s Seed and Heirs, according to the Promiſe, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.29. Whence it is undeniably evident, that believing Gentiles are heirs to <hi>Abraham</hi>'s bleſſing, or to the Promiſe made to <hi>Abraham,</hi> with reference to his Seed, as they are conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered under that potion and conſideration as his Seed.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Which follows from this, that they are Heirs to that Promiſe, or the bleſſing contained in that Promiſe made to <hi>Abraham,</hi> with reference to his Seed, which bleſſing, as I have proved before, was the ſame with that
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:106624:112"/>which <hi>Abraham</hi> himſelf was bleſſed with: theſe two things cannot be gainſaid, but muſt be granted by all that will not in expreſs terms contradict the Apoſtle.</p>
               <p>Now then let me a little argue with our Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſers thus; either that Covenant entred with <hi>Abraham,</hi> and entred with believeing Gentiles, is one and the ſame, or they are two Covenants, ſpecifically diverſe the one from the other: The firſt they deny the latter they affairm. Well them, the Promiſe contained in it was ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a Promiſe of a meer temporal good, or a ſpiritual good. Yes, ſay our Oppoſers, it was a temporal good, as the Promiſe was made to <hi>Abraham,</hi> with reference to his natural Seed. Well then the bleſſing or good contained in this very Promiſe, as it was made to <hi>Abraham,</hi> with reference to his ſpiritual or myſtical Seed, is either a temporal or a ſpiritual good; the latter here muſt, and I ſuppoſe will, be granted by our Oppoſers themſelves: It is evident then, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Judgment of our Oppoſers, that the ſame Promiſe made to <hi>Abraham,</hi> with refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to his natural Seed, and as made to him with reference to them, only importing a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral good, may be given to, and ſet led upon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving Gentiles, and that by the Covenant of Grace, and that as given to, and ſetled upon them, may import and ſignifie a ſpiritual good; but it is the Covenant of Grace, that is made with believing Gentiles, is agreed on all hands; that believing Gentiles are Heirs to that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe made to <hi>Abraham,</hi> with reference to his
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:106624:113"/>Seed, is expreſly affirmed by the Apoſtle, whence it will undeniably follow, that either the Covenant muſt be one and the ſame, and the Promiſes thereof intend one and the ſame good, as made both with reference to <hi>Abraham</hi>'s natural, and alſo his ſpiritual Seed, which is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly the truth; or elſe that the ſame Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe made to <hi>Abraham,</hi> with reference to his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Seed, according to that Covenant then en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred with him; and that as ſo made, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to them, may import only a temporal good, may yet be given to, and ſetled upon believing Gentiles, by another Covenant, and that as given to, and ſetled upon them, may import a ſpiritual good; and conſequently that the Promiſe may run in the ſame extent and latitude, in which it was made to <hi>Abraham,</hi> as now it is made to believing Gentiles, though the Covenant, in which that Promiſe was contained, as made to <hi>Abraham,</hi> was really and ſpecifically diverſe from that that Covenant, in which that Promiſe is contained, as made to believing Gentiles; for if ſo be the ſame Promiſe, as ſimply and abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely conſidered, may be given unto and ſetled upon believing Gentiles, by a Covenant diverſe from that, according to which it was firſt given to <hi>Abraham,</hi> why may not that Promiſe be given unto, and ſetled upon believing Gentiles, in the ſame latitude and extent in which it was firſt given to <hi>Abraham;</hi> It the Promiſe be given to believing Gentiles, why may it not be given in the full extent and latitude of it? Certainly no rational account can be given. And here let it
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:106624:113"/>be carefully obſerved, that both we and our Oppoſers are agreed, That <hi>Abraham</hi>'s bleſſing, or the good contained in that Promiſe, wherein God ingaged tob e a God to him and his Seed, is granted to believing Gentiles; all the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion is, whether it be given to them in the ſame latitude and extent, in which it: was given to <hi>Abraham</hi> and his natural Seed; whence it lyes upon our Objectors to ſhew ſome Reaſon why, ſuppoſing there ſhould be ſuch a difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween theſe two ſuppoſed covenants, the Promiſe may not be continued in the ſame latitude and extent, in which it was at firſt given; as well as the Promiſe it ſelf, abſolutely taken, may be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven or continued to believing Gentiles, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding that difference they imagtne be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween theſe ſuppoſed diſtinct Covenants, ſo that the granting the Covenants to be really and ſpecifically diverſe one from the other, no more oppoſeth the truth of this our ſecond Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, than it doth oppoſe what the Objectors themſelves do hold, at leaſt which they muſt hold, unleſs they will expreſly contradict the Apoſtle in what he expreſly affirms: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I ſay, upon the ſuppoſal of what the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectors themſelves muſt grant, the affirming and maintaining the Promiſe to run in the ſame la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude and extent to believing Gentiles, in which it ran in unto <hi>Abraham,</hi> doth not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily require the affirming or maintaining, that the Covenant is one and the ſame: our Oppoſers muſt grant, that the Promiſe made to <hi>Abraham,</hi> either with reference to himſelf, or
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:106624:114"/>with reference to his Seed, and it is all one, whether we take it the one way or the other, is given to, and fetled upon believing Gentiles, we ſay it is given to, and ſetled upon them, in the ſame latitude and extent in which it was given to <hi>Abraham,</hi> both in reference to himſelf and his natural Seed: and now ſuppoſing the Covenant believing Gentiles are under, ſhould be really diverſe from that entred with <hi>Abraham,</hi> how that ſhould contradict what we affirm, more than it ſhould contradict what the Objectors themſelves muſt grant, is impoſſible to imagine. So that, I ſay, the Covenant is one and the ſame for ſubſtance; but ſuppoſing it were not, yet our Propoſition might and would hold true.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> It is objected by ſome, That the Infant-ſeed of believing Gentiles cannot, with any ſhew of reaſon, be ſuppoſed to be taken in as joynt Subjects of the Covenant of Grace; and the Promiſes thereof, with their Parents, meerly upon the account of their Parents faith, in as much as we ſee plainly, that the Jews themſelves, though they were the natural Seed of <hi>Abraham</hi> (whoſe Seed in reaſon ſhould have enjoyed as great priviledges as the natural Seed of any believing Gentile) could not upon the meer account of their fleſhly deſcent from <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham,</hi> be admitted into the Goſpel-covenant, but for their unbelief were rejected, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding their relation unto <hi>Abraham,</hi> as his natural. Now ſay our Oppoſers, if ſo be, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the natural Seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> or the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:106624:114"/>Seed of Believers, had been or were to be received into the Goſpel-covenant, together with their parents, meerly upon the account of their Parents faith, and had had, or have, as the Seed of ſuch Parents, a right to the Ordinances and Priviledges of that Covenant, then the Jews, they being the natural Seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> had had a right to the Goſpel-covenant, and might, yea, ought to have been admitted into the Goſpel-church by Baptiſm, by vertue of that their Relation to <hi>Abraham,</hi> as his natural Seed, and could not juſtly have been refuſed for the want of a perſonal faith and repentance of their own, they being, notwithſtanding their want of a perſonal faith and repentance, yet <hi>Abraham</hi>'s natural Seed, and therefore certainly the Jews had either wrong done them by the Apoſtles, in not admitting them by Baptiſm into the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel-church, or elſe we muſt relinquiſh our plea for Infant-right to Baptiſm, upon the account of their joynt intereſt in the Covenant, together with their Parents; for can we think the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles would ſo highly wrong the Jews, as to deny them that priviledge which, as <hi>Abraham's</hi> Seed, they had a right unto? or can it be imagined, that they, though the natural Seed of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> who was ſuch an eminent believer, and the Father of the faithful, ſhould have no right to be admitted into the Goſpel church, and yet the fleſhly Seed of believing Gentiles ſhould have a right to ſuch an admiſſion: And that which makes this Objection ſeem more weighty to ſome is, that they ſuppoſe we hole, that the
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:106624:115"/>Inſant-ſeed of believing Parents do ſtand rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to <hi>Abraham</hi> as his Seed, and do baptize them upon that account: And how the Infant-ſeed of believing Gentiles ſhould be ſuppoſed to ſtand related to <hi>Abraham</hi> as his Seed, and upon that account be baptized, when his own natural Seed could no longer bear the denomination of his Seed, with reference to the Promiſes of the Covenant of Grace, cannot be imagined, but ſeems to be matter of great wonder, yea, and amazement unto ſome.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> I anſwer, What hath been already ſaid, both for the explication of this term <hi>Seed,</hi> and for the removal of ſome Objections raiſed up againſt the truth, aſſerted in the foregoing Propoſitions, hath ſo far obviated and prevented this Objection, as that little more need be added for the removing of it out of our way: The Objection, as we may eaſily ſee, is grounded up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and receives what ſtrength it hath from a twofold Suppoſition.</p>
               <p>Firſt, A Suppoſition that we affirm, at leaſt that it will unavoidably follow from what we do affirm, that <hi>Abraham</hi>'s natural Seed, both immediately and mediately proceeding from his loms, had a right to the Covenant of Grace, and the promiſes, benefits and priviledges thereof, meerly by vertue of their relation to <hi>Abraham,</hi> as his natural Seed.</p>
               <pb n="203" facs="tcp:106624:115"/>
               <p>Secondly, A Suppoſition that we hold, that the natural Seed of believing Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles are, by vertue of that their relation to ſuch believing Parents, accounted for the Seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and on that account to be baptiſed.</p>
               <p>Now as to the former of theſe Suppoſitions, it will ſoon appear, to all that attend to what hath been ſaid, that I am no way concerned in it, having affirmed, and I hope ſufficiently pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, the quite contrary, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, as at fixſt eſtabliſhed with <hi>Abraham,</hi> did not conſtitute a Covenant-relation between God and any of his natural Seed, meerly as ſuch, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond thoſe that did immediately proceed from his own loins, but that the right and intereſt that any individual or particular perſon of his natural Seed, during their Infant-capacity, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond his immediate Children, had in the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant and Promiſes of it, aroſe from their relation to their immediate Parents, included with them in that phraſe, <hi>their Generations,</hi> and that the compleating and continuance of that Covenant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relation did neceſſarily and indiſpenſably re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire their own faith and repentance, ſo ſoon as grown up to a capacity inabling them thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, whence, as ſuch; who in their Infancy had a right to, and intereſt in the Covenant, and Promiſes thereof, either by vertue of their rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to <hi>Abraham,</hi> as his natural Seed, thus, in reſpect of his own immediate Children, or by vertue of the relation to Covenant parents,
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:106624:116"/>thus, in reſpect of the Jews mediately deſcended from <hi>Abraham,</hi> during the firſt Teſtament admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration, I ſay, as ſuch, might, when grown up to years of maturity, fail in the performing the conditions of the Covenant, and thereupon be rejected of God; ſo they having loſt their own Covenant-ſtate and relation, could not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey a right to, or intereſt in the Covenant and Promiſes thereof to their Children, their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drens Govenant ſtate and relation ſtanding or falling with their own; whence it is evident, that as neither the Jews themſelves, as grown up, and as Parents, had any right to the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, as adminiſtred under the firſt Teſtament, but what depended upon their perſonal ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance and performance of the conditions of the Covenant, as then propoſed to, and admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred among them, nor their Infant-ſeed any right of admiſſion into a praticipation of the benefits and bleſſings of the Covenant, as then adminitred, but upon a ſuppoſition of their immediate Parents abiding in Covenant; ſo now the continuance of their right (conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as grown up and as Parents) to the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant and bleſſings thereof, as now varied and altered in its adminiſtration, depended upon their acceptation and performance of the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Covenant, as now propoſed under this preſent adminiſtration, and as the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of their own right to the Covenant, and the priviledges thereof, depended upon their own acceptation and performance of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, as now adminiſtred, ſo their Childrens
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:106624:116"/>right to, and intereſt in the Covenant, and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vildeges thereof, ſtood or fell with their own; and hence the Jews, as grown up to years of maturity, or as Parents, refuſing to accept of and perform the Conditions of the Covenant, as now differently adminiſtred under the New Teſtament, from what it was under the Old, were perſonally rejected, ſuppoſing them ſingle perſons, and were both themſelves and their Children (ſuppoſing their Children were in their Infancy) rejected from their ſtanding any longer in their former Covenant-ſtate and rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion God ward: So that this Suppoſition having no footing in any thing I have hitherto ſaid, the Objection it felf, ſo far as grounded upon it, no way concerns the truth aſſerted in the one or the other foregoing Propoſitions, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently I am not at all concerned to reply un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it.</p>
               <p>Now for the other Propoſtition this Object<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is grounded upon, I acknowledge my ſelf concerned in it, and do freely grant, yea, poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivelv affirm, That the Infant-ſeed of believing Gentiles are to be accounted of, and numbred among <hi>Abraham</hi>'s myſtical Seed: what reſpect we have to that their myſtical relation to <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> as his Seed, in the application of Baptiſm to them, will be more fitly conſidered under the laſt Propoſition: But that they are to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted of, and numbred among <hi>Abrabam</hi>'s myſtical Seed, I affirm, and it ſufficiently appears from hence, <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Seed in their
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:106624:117"/>generations make up but one myſtical Seed; This is evident from <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.7. where ſaith the Lord, <hi>I eſtabliſh my Covenant between me and thee, and thy Seed after thee in their generarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, to be a God to thee, and thy Seed after thee:</hi> So that Seed in their geuerations is expounded by God himſelf to be, <hi>Seed after thee;</hi> Seed in their generations makes up that one Seed: and to the ſame purpoſe is that of the Apoſtle, in <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.16. <hi>He ſaith not, To Seeds, as of many, but, To thy Seed, which is Chriſt.</hi> Whence it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, that all the individual and particular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, whether grown up, or Infants, that are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded in that Promiſe, as made to <hi>Abraham,</hi> with reference to his Seed, make up but one Seed, <hi>which,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>is Chriſt.</hi> Now that the Infant-ſeed of believing Gentiles, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Goſpel adminiſtration, as well as the Infant-ſeed of the Jews, under the firſt Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment adminiſtration, are included with their Parents in that phraſe, <hi>Thy Seed in their gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations,</hi> hath been abundantly proved alreadly: ſo that I ſay I grant, yea affirm, that the Infant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeed of believing Gentiles are to be reckoned of, and numbred among <hi>Abraham</hi>'s myſtical Seed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> 1. Firſt, That the Scripture ſtill makes Faith the condition, or medium, of Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles becoming <hi>Abraham</hi>'s myſtical Seed, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.12, 16. Whence it ſeems evident, that <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> is a myſtical Father to none but Believrs, and his Seed are only ſuch as are of the Faith.</p>
               <pb n="207" facs="tcp:106624:117"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> I anſwer, The Scripture is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to it ſelf: Now we have ſeen, that under that phraſe, <hi>Thy Seed in their generations,</hi> the Infant-ſeed both of Jews and Gentiles are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded; and that this, <hi>Seed in their generations,</hi> is but <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Seed after him: Whence it is evident, the Apoſtle in ſaying, that <hi>Abraham</hi> is the Father of them that believe, excludes not, but on the other hand include the Infant-ſeed of ſuch as do believe, as to be accounted with their Parents, as making up but one Seed; he is the Father of them that do believe, whether Jews or Gentiles in their generations.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obejct.</hi> 2. Secondly, It is objected, That then we make three parties in the Covenant.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>Firſt, <hi>Abraham.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>Secondly, His Seed.</item>
                  <item>Thirdly, Their Infant-ſeed.</item>
               </list>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> In anſwer, We make but two par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, <hi>Abraham,</hi> and his Seed, the Infant-ſeed of Believers makes not a third party, but ſtands in the ſame capacity, reſpective to <hi>Abraham,</hi> that their Parents do, and he is to be looked upon as a common Father to Parents, and their Infant-ſeed, the ſeveral individuals, whether Parents or infants, are all but the ſeveral mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers or parts of that one <hi>totum,</hi> that one collective body, <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Seed: from all it appears, that this Objection, in part, concerns not me, and ſo far as it doth eoncern me, is no way oppoſite to what I have affirmed, but is
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:106624:118"/>granted without the leaſt prejudice to the truth pleaded for.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> 3. It is objected by ſome, That In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants cannot be under the Covenant of Grace, becauſe the Covenant of Grace promiſeth di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine teachings to all that are under it, the iſſue of which is the ſaving knowledge of God, which as Infants for the preſent are incapable of; ſo it is certain, that many of the infants of Believres are never made partakers of; now if they are admitted into Covenant, and are actually under the Promiſes of it, they muſt needs be taught of God, and that ſo as to know him, at leaſt they would, as they grow up to a capacity, be ſo taught of God; ſee the Promiſe, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 54.15. <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.34. <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.10.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> I anſwer, This Objection hath been removed already, but yet for further ſatisfaction I ſhall lay down theſe two Propoſitions.</p>
               <p>Fiaſt, That ſome may be actually in the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Grace, who yet are not ſo taught of God, as ſavingly to know him: this might be evidenced from that diſtinction formerly laid down, concerning an exterual and internal be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in Covenant: It is poſſible. perſons may be, yea, it is certain many are, externally in Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, who are not internally in Covenant, the neceſſity of this diſtinction hath been already ſhewed, and the abſurdities that would follow, in eaſe it ſhould be dined, declared. Now in
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:106624:118"/>reſpect of ſuch who are only externaly in Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, it is certain, though they are in Covenant, and under the promiſes of it, according to its true tenour, as ſo externally made, yet are not ſo taught of God, as ſavingly to know him, for then they would be, not only externally, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally in Covenant.</p>
               <p>Secondly, That this Promiſe made to the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant-people of God, aſſuring them, that they ſhall be all, from the leaſt to the greateſt, taught of God, ſo as ſavingly to know him, doth not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly ſecure the good promiſed to every in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual perſon, to whom the promiſe, as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally promulgated and declared, doth, in common with others appertain.</p>
               <p>And for the proof of this Poſition I would argue thus, If it do infailliby ſecure the good promiſed to every individual perſon to whom it doth externally appertain, it muſt be either by vertue of the univerſality of the terms, or by vertue of the nature and kind of the promiſe it ſelf, or by vertue of the nature of quality of the good promiſed. That it is by vertue of the nature or quality of the good promiſed none can pretend, and that it is neither of the former wayes I ſhall prove diſtinctly.</p>
               <p>Firſt, That it cannot be by vertue of the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſality of the terms in which the promiſe is expreſt, is evident thus, becauſe indefinite pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes may be, and many times are expreſt in univerſal terms, and then, though the terms be
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:106624:119"/>univerſal, yet the promiſes may not be made good to every individual perſon, to whom, in common wtth others, they do appertain; <hi>If I be life up,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>I will draw all men to me, John</hi> 12.32. The terms are univerſal, yet the promiſe is an indefinite promiſe, he would draw many unto him. So again, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.17. <hi>I will pour out my Spirit upon all fleſh:</hi> where we ſee again the terms are univerſal, yet the promiſe is verified only in ſome particular perſons.</p>
               <p>But here you will ſay, In this place the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe is expreſt with a peculiar emphaſis, <hi>They ſhall all know me, from the leaſt to the greateſt;</hi> and therefore it muſt needs be underſtood uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally.</p>
               <p>To that I anſwer, Whether we underſtand this phraſe, <hi>From the leaſt to the greateſt,</hi> of age, or ſtate, or condition, is not much to our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent purpoſe; we find the very ſame phraſe uſed, when yet the ſence is only indefinite, thus, <hi>Jer.</hi> 6.13. <hi>From the leaſt to the greateſt, every one is given to covetouſneſs;</hi> which yet was not uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally true of every individual perſon among that people, whether Infant or grown perſon, nor of every individual grown perſon, it only notes the mighty, and almoſt univerſal corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of that people in point of Covetouſneſs. So that every individual perſon, externally in the Covenant of Grace, and ſo in common with others, having this promiſe appertaining to them, ſhall be ſavingly taught of God, ſo as truly to
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:106624:119"/>know him, cannot be inferred, or certainly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded from the univerſality of the terms it is expreſſed in.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Nor from the nature of the por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe; for if the nature of the promiſe do in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly ſecure the good promiſed to every in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual perſon in covenant, as before expreſt, it muſt be either, as it is a conditional, or as it is an abſolute promiſe; as it is conditional, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be pretended, in as much as no conditional promiſes, as ſuch, do infallibly ſecure the good promiſed to any to whom they do appertain, it is poſſibly the condition may not be performed, and then God is diſobliged from making good the promiſes.</p>
               <p>It is true, you will ſay, ſuppoſing it were a conditional promiſe, it would not infallibly ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure the good promiſed to all univerſally, to whom it doth appertain; but it is an abſolute promiſe, and the abſoluteneſs of the promiſe, taken in conjunction with the univerſality of the terms, doth ſure infallibly ſecure the good promiſed to all univerſally to whom it doth ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertain.</p>
               <p>I anſwer, That the promiſe, though there expreſt abſolutely, yet is not abſolutely abſolute, as before proved, ſo though expreſt in univerſal terms, yet may be and is an indefinite promiſe, indefinite promiſes being often expreſt in uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal terms; yea, let me ſay, that abſolute pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes,
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:106624:120"/>how univerſally ſoever their terms are, are yet to be alwayes underſtood in an indefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite notion, and the good promiſed is not infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libly ſecured to any individual or particular perſon, meerly by the promiſes themſelves, but only upon ſuppoſition of the eternal purpoſes and decrees of the God, to give the good ſo promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to this or that particular perſon: in reſpect of abſolute promiſes, God hath reſerved a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bery, to himſelf, to give or withhold the good promiſed, ina commenſurableneſs to his eternal decrees and purpoſes, and according as particular perſons are elected and appointed to the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the good promiſed, or not elected or paſſed by.</p>
               <p>From all it evidently appears, that perſons may have a viſible and external actual right and thle to this promiſe, and yet never have the good promiſed in preſent poſſeſſion, nor yet ever have it made good to them, and conſequently it cannot be concluded from the abſoluteneſs or univerſality of this promiſe, that the Infant-ſeed of believing Parents are not in the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace, nor under the promiſes of it.</p>
               <p>But let that ſuffice for our ſecond ſubordinate Propoſition.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>The third ſubordinate Propoſition laid down; how handled declared. The firſt Argument for its confirmation propoſed and proſecuted, where that Command, concerning the keeping of the Covenant, <hi>Gen. 17.9.</hi> is largely ſpoken to.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>I Come now to the third and laſt ſubordinate Propoſition, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That all thoſe that are under, or are the actual Subjects of that Promiſe, wherein God inga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged himſelf to be a God to</hi> Abraham, <hi>and his Seed in their Generations, ought, according to the will of Chriſt, to be baptized: all that are the Subjects of that Promiſe are the due and proper Subjects of Baptiſm: There may be, its true, a tender of the Promiſe to ſuch who ought not to be baptized, they may refeſe that tender, but to whom the Promiſe doth actually belong, the Ordinance of Baptiſme ought, according to the will of Chriſt, to be apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="214" facs="tcp:106624:121"/>
               <p>This Propoſition I ſhall endeavour to prove in <hi>hypotheſi,</hi> or as applied to the particular ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of our main Propoſition, <hi>viz.</hi> the Infant-ſeed of one or both believing Parents; and thus ſuppoſing, and taking it for granted (as being already proved) that they are the actual Subjects of that Promiſe, I ſhall prove that they ought, according to the will of Chriſt, to be baptiſed, and that by theſe three Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</p>
               <p>Firſt, If it be the duty of believing Parents, not only to be baptized themſelves, but to take care that their Infant-ſeed, as joynt Subjects with themſelves of that promiſe, be alſo bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, then it is according to the will of Chriſt, that not only believing Parents themſelves, but their Infant-ſeed alſo ſhould be baptized: but the former is true, therefore the latter.</p>
               <p>The Conſequence in the Major propoſition is unqueſtionable, what a Believer is bound to take care be done, the doing of that muſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly be according to the will of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>But 'tis the Minor propoſition will be denied, <hi>viz.</hi> That it is the duty of believing Parents, not only to be baptized themſelves, but to take care that their Infant-Seed, as joynt Subjects with themſelves of the ſame promiſe, be bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed.</p>
               <p>But the truth of this is evident from the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs Command of God, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.9. <hi>And God ſaid unto Abraham, Thou ſhalt keep my Covenant therefore, thou and thy Seed after thee in their Generations.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="215" facs="tcp:106624:121"/>
               <p>Now that it may appear, that this Command doth conſtitute it to be the duty of believing Parents, not only to be baptized themſelves, but to take care that their Infant-ſeed be alſo baptized, I ſhall diſtinctly ſpeak to theſe five things.</p>
               <p>Firſt, That by Covenant in this place is main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, if not only meant, the Token of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and by keeping the Covenant, the appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation and reception of that Token.</p>
               <p>Secondly, That the Covenant that <hi>Abraham,</hi> and his Seed in their Generations, were, or were to be received into, alwayes had and was to have a Token annexed to it.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, That this Command requiring <hi>Abraham,</hi> and his Seed in their Generations, to keep the Covenant, obliges not only Parents to have the Token applyed to themſelves or them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to receive and bear it, but to apply or take care that it be applyed, according to divine appointment, to their Infant-ſeed.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, That as Circumciſion was the Token of the Covenant during the old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment adminiſtration, ſo Baptiſm is the Token of the Covenant under the New.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, That this Command doth equally and alike oblige believing Parents in their Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations, reſpective to Baptiſm, the preſent
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:106624:122"/>Token of the Covenant, as it did the Jews, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective to Circumciſion, the then Token of the Covenant.</p>
               <p>For the firſt, That is paſt all rational doubt evident; God himſelf ſhews what he intended by Covenant, and what by keeping of that Covenant: When he applyes this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, as more generally laid down to <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> and his natural Seed in particular, verſe 10. So verſe 13. <hi>My Covenant ſhall be in your fleſh,</hi> plainly declaring, that by Covenant he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended the Token of the Covenant, and by keeping of this Covenant, the application and reception of that Token, though not affirming Circumciſion to be the only Covenant to be kept, and conſequently not limiting the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand to it.</p>
               <p>And here let us a little inquire into the ſence and meaning of this term <hi>Token;</hi> the Hebrew <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> is uſually tranſlated by the Seventy <gap reason="foreign">

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> and Sign or token here we are to take in a pure logical notion, and thus we may define it with <hi>Auſten,</hi> to be, <hi>Id quod ſeipſum ſenſui &amp; preter ſe aliquid animo repreſentat:</hi> Or as a later Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, <hi>Signum eſt quod ſeipſum ſenſibus &amp; id cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jus ſignum eſt intellectui aufert:</hi> A Sign in this logical notion is, that which is obvious to, or perceivable by ſence, and through the medium
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:106624:122"/>of ſence preſents to the mind or underſtanding what it is a ſign of: Whence it is evident, that this term, <hi>Token or Sign,</hi> is not expreſſive of all the uſes or ends that the Token of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant here commanded was deſigned or appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to: the term abſtractly taken, only expreſſes the general nature and deſign of that Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, but expreſſes not the various uſes and ends it was in particular appointed to; what theſe uſes and ends are, muſt be gathered from other Scriptures, wherein God himſelf hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared them, of which I ſhall ſpeak when I come to the fourth Particular.</p>
               <p>But let that ſuffice in brief for the firſt parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular to be ſpoken to.</p>
               <p>Secondly, That the Covenant that <hi>Abraham,</hi> and his Seed in their Generations, were, or were to be received into, alwayes had, and was to have a Token annexed to it; that is, it had, and was to have an outward Ordinance or Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion annexed unto the adminiſtration of it, which though of various uſes, and ſerving to various ends, not expreſly declared in that term <hi>Token,</hi> abſtractly taken, yet might be denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Token of the Covenant. This is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent two wayes.</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>A priore,</hi> from the Command of God, injoyning <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Seed in their Generations to keep it.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>A poſteriori,</hi> or <hi>de facto,</hi> from the
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:106624:123"/>actual inſtitution and appointment of ſuch a Token.</p>
               <p>For the firſt, Let the words in <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.9. be diligently obſerved, <hi>And God ſaid unto Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, Thou ſhalt therefore keep my Covenant, thou and thy Seed after thee in their Generations.</hi> Now God would never have injoyned <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> and his Seed in their Generations, to keep his Covenant, that is, the Token of it, had he not intended to annex a Token to it. And ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve it, the Command lyes on <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Seed in their Generations, without any limitation, and conſequently is incumbent upon <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Seed, while he hath a Seed upon earth. Hence it is evident, that as God intended to annex a Token to that Covenant, then entred with <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> and his natural Seed, ſo he intended to annex a Token to his Covenant (whether the ſame, or another, it is all one as to our preſent purpoſe) into which <hi>Abraham</hi>'s ſpiritual Seed, <hi>viz.</hi> believing Gentiles, in after Ages ſhould be received, we ſee the Command lyes upon <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Seed in their Generations unlimit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly.</p>
               <p>Now Believers under the new Teſtament, as hath been proved, are <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Seed, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently muſt needs lye under the Obligation of this Command, whence there muſt needs be a Token annexed to the Covenant into which they are received, for otherwiſe they would lye under an Obligation to keep the Token of the Covenant, and yet have no Token appointed
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:106624:123"/>them by God, to keep which would be abſurd: And that this Command is obliging to <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>'s myſtical or ſpiritual Seed, is evident by this Argument.</p>
               <p>The ſame perſons intended in the Promiſes of the Covenant, are intended in the Command, injoyning the Token: But <hi>Abraham</hi>'s myſtical Seed, as well as his natural Seed, are intended in the Promiſes; therefore they are alſo intended in the Command.</p>
               <p>We evidently ſee, the Promiſes and the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand run in one and the ſame extent and lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude; <hi>I will eſtabliſh my Covenant between me and thee, and thy Seed after thee in their Generations, to be a God to thee and thy Seed after thee,</hi> there's the Promiſe: <hi>Thou ſhalt therefore keep my Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, thou and thy Seed after thee in their Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations,</hi> there's the Command.</p>
               <p>Now if God hath not limited the Command to ſome of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Seed, then we muſt not do it: But God hath no where limited the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand to ſome of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Seed; therefore muſt not we.</p>
               <p>If any ſhould ſay, He hath limited that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand.</p>
               <p>Let that limitation be produced, and it ſhall ſuffice; till then we ſhall conclude, the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand is of an equal extent with the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe.</p>
               <pb n="220" facs="tcp:106624:124"/>
               <p>Now there being a Command incumbent up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Abraham</hi>'s whole Seed myſtical, as well as natural, to keep the Covenant, that is, as God himſelf expounds it, the Token of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, there muſt needs be a Token to be kept.</p>
               <p>Secondly, This is evident, <hi>de facto,</hi> for the Covenant under the firſt Teſtament adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that will not be denyed, and for the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant under the new Teſtament adminiſtration, the truth of what I affirm will appear, when I come to ſhew that Baptiſm is the preſent Token of the Covenant.</p>
               <p>And therefore thirdly, That this Command, requiring <hi>Abraham,</hi> and his Seed in their Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations, to keep the Covenant, obliges not only Parents to have the Token of the Covenant ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed unto themſelves, or themſelves to receive and bear it, but alſo to apply or take care that it be applyed to their Infant-ſeed. The truth of this will again appear two wayes.</p>
               <p>Firſt, From the Letter of the Command, <hi>Thou ſhalt therefore keep my Covenant, thou and thy Seed in their Generations.</hi> Now under this phraſe, <hi>thy Seed in their Generations,</hi> both Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents and their Infant-ſeed are included; they are both included in the Promiſe, as hath been already proved, and therefore muſt needs be both included in the Command injoyning the keeping of the Covenant, Hence, that the Covenant
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:106624:124"/>be kept by the Seed as well as by the Parents themſelves, is according to the expreſs letter of the Command, which duty of keeping, as to be performed by the Infant-ſeed, can only intend their reception and bearing of it; and ſo far the Infant-Seed as well as the Parents are under the Obligation of the Command: hence an Infant, not receiving or bearing the Token of the Covenant, is ſaid to have broken the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, verſe 14. becauſe the Infants as well as the Parents are under the Obligation of the Command to keep the Covenant.</p>
               <p>Now if ſo be the Covenant be to be kept, not only by Parents, but by their Infant-ſeed, it will undeniably follow, that Parents are to take care that it be kept by them, in as much as they, as ſuch, are incapable of taking care of it them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, the care muſt lye upon ſome body, and upon whom, if not upon their Parents? We ſee that God hath throughout the Scripture made it the duty of Parents to take care of, and ſee to the performance of his will relating to their children, as might be evidenced in variety of inſtances were it needful.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The truth of this appears from the clear and expreſs diſcovery that God made of his mind and will as to Circumciſion, the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Token of the Covenant, and thus as God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned the token of the Covenant to be applyed to the Infant-ſeed of Covenant-parents, ſo he impoſed the care of the application of that To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken unto the Seed upon the Parents, <hi>Every man-child
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:106624:125"/>among you ſhall be circumciſed,</hi> verſe 10. <hi>He that is eight dayes old, ſhall be circumciſed among you,</hi> verſe 12. The Child in the applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Token was paſſive, and though upon whom the care of the application of the Token to the Infant-ſeed was laid, is not expreſly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared in this place, yet that it was upon the Parents is ſufficiently evident throughout the Scripture. We ſee how angry God was with <hi>Moſes,</hi> when the circumciſion of his Child was neglected; and in that God ſo fully declared his mind in reſpect of Circumciſion, the then Token of the Covenant, it is a full comment upon the Command, as more generally laid down, <hi>viz.</hi> That as in that phraſe, <hi>Thy Seed in their Generations,</hi> he intended both Parents and Infant-ſeed; ſo that the care of the Childs receiving and bearing the Token of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant (which is the whole of its keeping of it) did appertain to the Parents as their duty.</p>
               <p>And hence let it be obſerved, that the will of God concerning Circumciſion, ſhews us what is his will concerning Baptiſm, that as the one, ſo the other ſhould be applyed to the Infants of believing Parents, as well as to the Parents themſelves, and that the care of the application of the one, as well as of the other, lyes upon the Parents.</p>
               <p>Where note, that I argue not from Anallogy, but only take that diſcovery God makes of his will concerning Circumciſion, as a Comment upon that Command injoyning the keeping of the Covenant, as more generally laid down.</p>
               <pb n="223" facs="tcp:106624:125"/>
               <p>But not to inlarge upon this, by what hath been ſaid the truth of the third particular ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently appears.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, That as Circumciſion was the Sign or Token of the Covenant, during the old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment adminiſtration, ſo Baptiſm is the Sign or Token of the Covenant under the new Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment adminiſtration. Where note, that when I ſay, Circumciſion was, and Baptiſm is, the Sign or Token of the Covenant, I would be thus underſtood, <hi>viz.</hi> that Circumciſion was, and Baptiſm is, that Ordinance or Inſtitution that God then did annex, and now hath annex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Covenant, ſerving to, and performing of thoſe various uſes and ends, with reference unto thoſe to whom it was, and is to be apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that he propoſed to himſelf, as the reaſon and ground of his annexing a Sign or Token in the general to the Covenant eſtabliſhed between himſelf and <hi>Abraham,</hi> and his Seed in their Generations.</p>
               <p>That Circumciſion was this Ordinance or Inſtitution, is expreſly declared, <hi>Geneſis:</hi> 17.10, 11.</p>
               <p>That Baptiſm is the preſent Sign or To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of the Covenant will appear theſe two wayes.</p>
               <p>Firſt, More generally, and thus: Unleſs Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm be the preſent Sign or Token of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, the Covenant, during this preſent admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration, is left wholly deſtitute of any Sign
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:106624:126"/>or Token at all; let the Sign or Token be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced in caſe Baptiſm be not it.</p>
               <p>'Tis true, it may be it will be ſaid, That the Covenant under, the preſent adminiſtration, hath no external Sign or Token annexed to it, neither is it neceſſary that it ſhould; the Spirit is the Seal of the Covenant of Grace, and the more plentiful powrings forth of the Spirit upon Believers, eſpecially under that notion of a Seal, makes an outward Sign or Token wholly unneceſſary.</p>
               <p>To that I anſwer:</p>
               <p>Firſt, That though Believers are ſaid to be ſealed with the Spirit, yet the Spirit is no where called the Seal of the Covenant, neither indeed can it in propriety of ſpeech be ſo called; for if the Spirit were the Seal of the Covenant, it ſhould be given to all that are under the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, the contrary thereunto both Scripture and experience abundantly declare, the Seal of me Covenant muſt be as extenſive as the Covenant whereof it is the Seal. Now take the Spirit as a Seal, that is, as given for that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular uſe and end, <hi>viz.</hi> to aſſure and aſcertain the Subject recipient of it, of the good pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed in the Covenant, and ſo it is certain he is not given to every one truly and internally in covenant for a long time, nor to ſome poſſibly while they live. How many live many years, and it may be at laſt dye without any ſenſible aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of their covenant-ſtate, or injoyment of
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:106624:126"/>the good promiſed; I ſo that the Spirit cannot properly be called the Seal of the Covenant, he is rather (as I may ſo expreſs it) a private Seal given by God to this or that particular Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever, according to the good pleaſure of his own will.</p>
               <p>Secondly, I anſwer, That to ſeal and aſſure to thoſe who are admitted into covenant with God, their injoyment of the good promiſed is not the only uſe and end, with reference where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto the Sign or Token of the Covenant is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed.</p>
               <p>Hence ſuppoſe it ſhould be granted, that the Spirit is the Seal, yea, the only Seal of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Grace, yet that doth no way oppoſe the truth of what we here affirm concerning Baptiſm, for though it ſhould be not or that particular uſe, nor appointed for that ſpecial end which yet it is, as will appear by and by, yet it may be the Sign or Token of the Covenant, it may be of thoſe other uſes, and ſerve to thoſe other ends that God did propound to himſelf, as the reaſon and ground of his annexing a Sign or Token in the general, to the Covenant, ſo that it is certain, the Spirit cannot <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> rationally ſuppoſed to be that Sign or Token of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, which <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Seed in their Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations were injoyned to keep; and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, for ought what is ſaid of the Spirit, unleſs Baptiſm be the preſent Token of the Covenant, it is wholly deſtitute of any Sign or Token at all, which that it cannot be, hath been
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:106624:127"/>proved already: as for the Lords Supper, I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, none will ever imagine that that can be the Token here injoyned, if they ſhould, their vanity will eaſily appear.</p>
               <p>Secondly, This will more clearly appear, if we compare Baptiſm with Circumciſion, the former Token of the Covenant, that Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion was the Token of the Covenant is unque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtionable; and hence look what Ordinance un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the new Teſtament doth moſt fully agree with Circumciſion, in regard of the uſes and ends, which as the Token of the Covenant, it was appointed for, and did ſerve unto, that muſt needs be the Ordinance deſigned by our Lord Chriſt, for the Token of the Covenant, upon the ceſſation of Circumciſion: And here for the evidencing what is affirmed, I ſhall do theſe two things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Inſtance in ſome of the more eſpecial uſes and ends whereunto Circumciſion was appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and whereunto it, as the Sign of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, did ſerve.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Shew the exact agreement of Baptiſm with Circumciſion, in regard of thoſe uſes and ends: Where let it be carefully obſerved, that it is no way neceſſary, for the proving Baptiſm to be the preſent Sign or Token of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, that I ſhould prove an exact agreement between it and Circumciſion in all cicumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, nor yet in regard of all the uſes or ends of
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:106624:127"/>the one and of the other; if it be evident, that their agreement be ſuch as will evidence Baptiſm to be the Token of the Covenant, upon the ceſſation of Circumciſion, it is enough as to my preſent purpoſe, and that may be ſufficiently evident by their agreement in ſome things, though they ſhould diſagree in others, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially there being no other Ordinance that can with any ſhew of reaſon be pretended to be that Token, the application and reception of which is here enjoyned <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Seed in their Generations, a little may ſuffice to prove, that Baptiſm is that Ordinance, when there is no other Ordinance that can, with any ſhew of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability, be ſuppoſed to be it.</p>
               <p>I ſhall therefore only inſtance in a fourfold uſe and end, whereunto Circumciſion, as the Sign and Token of the Covenant, was appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and whereunto it did ſerve; and then ſhew the agreement of Baptiſm with Circumciſion, in regard of thoſe uſes and ends. The firſt and two laſt I ſhall do little more than mention, and a little inſiſt upon the ſecond.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Circumciſion, as the Sign and Token of the Covenant, was the ſolemn Rite or Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, whereby perſons were admitted into, and incorporated in the Jewiſh Church, and by the reception of which they became actual Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of that Church, and conſequently was that ſolemn Rite or Ordinance, whereby perſons were incorporated in, and united to the myſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Body of Chriſt as viſible: The proving of
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:106624:128"/>this, I ſuppoſe, is needleſs, 'twill ſurely be denyed by none. And therefore,</p>
               <p>Secondly, Circumciſion was to ſeal and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to the Subjects of it, their enjoyment of the good things, benefits and bleſſings promiſed in, according to the true tenour of, the Covenant, to the adminiſtration of which it was annexed: See this in a particular Inſtance, <hi>viz.</hi> Remiſſion of ſin, or the Righteouſneſs which is of Faith: Circumciſion was a Seal of the Righteouſneſs of Faith, that is, it did ſeal and aſſure, to the due Subjects of it, the non-imputation of their ſin, or the imputation of righteouſneſs to them, upon condition of their Faith. Thus it is ſaid of <hi>Abraham, He received the ſign of Circumciſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, a ſeal of the righteouſneſs of faith, which he had being yet uncircumciſed,</hi> Rom. 4.11. The Apoſtle here ſhews us one ſpecial uſe and end of Circumciſion, reſpective to all to whom it was duly applyed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> But here it is objected, That to have Circumciſion a Seal of the Righteouſneſs of Faith, was a priviledge peculiar to <hi>Abraham</hi> the Father of the faithful, and was not of that uſe, nor appointed for that end, to all to whom it was rightfully applyed: therefore it is ſaid, <hi>He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the ſign of Circumciſion, a ſeal of the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of faith, that he might be the Father of all that believe.</hi> And hence it may ſeem, that he receiving Circumciſion under that notion and conſideration, upon a reaſon and ground peculiar
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:106624:128"/>and proper to himſelf, the priviledge was pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar and proper to him, and not common to any other with him, there not being the ſame reaſon and ground of their receiving of it under the ſame notion and conſideration.</p>
               <p>To that I anſwer two things.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Thoſe words, <hi>That he might be the Father of all them that believe,</hi> depend not only upon the words immediately foregoing, but upon the tenth verſe taken in conjunction with the former part of v. 11. he did not only receive Circumciſion as a Seal, that he might be the Father of all them that believe, but he both had righteouſneſs imputed to him while in uncir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion, and alſo received the Sign of Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion as a Seal, that he might be the Father of them that ſhould believe, whether circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed or uncircumciſed: So that he did not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive Circumciſion, as a Seal of the righteouſneſs of faith, upon any reaſon peculiar and ſpecial to himſelf, any more than he had righteouſneſs imputed to him, upon a reaſon peculiar and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to himſelf: And conſequently, upon the ſame account that our Oppoſites appropriate cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion as a Seal of the righteouſneſs of faith to <hi>Abraham</hi> himſelf, and deny it to be of the ſame uſe to his Seed, they may appropriate the imputation of Righteouſneſs through Faith and Circumciſion it ſelf to him alone, and deny that any of his Seed had Righteouſneſs imputed unto them, or ought to have been circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed.</p>
               <pb n="230" facs="tcp:106624:129"/>
               <p>Secondly, I anſwer, That the Apoſtle here rather ſpeaks of the <hi>finis cui,</hi> than the <hi>finis cujus</hi> of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s receiving Circumciſion as a Seal: My meaning is this, <hi>Abraham</hi> received circumciſion as a Seal, not barely for the ſake of that relation, of his being a Father of them that ſhould believe, as it was a good benefit or privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge to himſelf, but he received it under that notion and conſideration, <hi>In eorum gratiam qui credituri ſint,</hi> for their ſake to whom he ſhould ſuſtain the relation of a Father: And ſo the meaning is, He received the Sign of Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion as a Seal of the Righteouſneſs of Faith, not barely that he might ſuſtain the relation of a Father to all that ſhould believe, as that was a good to himſelf, but that he might as a Father, or common perſon, be a pattern to all that ſhould ſuſtain that relation of Children to him, in regard of the good which they, as his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, ſhould receive.</p>
               <p>Now then having removed this Objection, I ſhall offer two or three Arguments to prove, that Circumciſion was appointed for this uſe and end. <hi>viz.</hi> to ſeal and confirm the whole Covenant to all to whom it was, according to the will of God, to be applyed.</p>
               <p>The firſt ſhall be taken from the end of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s receiving of it, as here declared by the Apoſtle: And thus I argue, If <hi>Abraham</hi> received Circumciſion, as a Seal of the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs which he had through Faith, that he might be the Father of, and as the Father of a
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:106624:129"/>pattern to all that being circumciſed ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, then to all that, being circumciſed, did believe, their circumciſion was and, ought to be looked upon and improved by them, as a Seal of that Righteouſneſs they had through Faith: But the former is true, therefore the latter. For the Conſequence in the Major propoſition. I ſuppoſe, that will not be denyed, it being paſt all rational doubt, that if <hi>Abraham</hi> received Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion under that very notion and conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration as a Seal, that he might be the Father of, and as the Father of, might be a pattern to all that, being circumciſed, ſhould believe as he did: Then look of what uſe it was to him, or to what end he received it; it muſt needs be of the ſame uſe, and appointed for the ſame end unto them, to whom he was a pattern as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving it. And therefore 'tis only the Antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent that can be queſtioned, which yet is ſo evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that to underſtanding and unprejudiced perſons the proving of it may ſeem wholly ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous. That <hi>Abraham</hi> received Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion under this very notion, as a Seal of the righteouſneſs which he had through faith, that he might be the Father of all them who being circumciſed did believe, is expreſly affirmed by the Apoſtle; all that can be doubted of is, whether he was, in regard of the uſe and end of it, as received by himſelf, a pattern to all to whom he was a Father: But now this is unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niable, in as much as his paternity or fatherhood, as I may ſo ſpeak, in part, if not principally, confiſted in his being a pattern and example to
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:106624:130"/>all tow hom he was a Father. This title of a Father is in a peculiar and ſpecial manner given to, and predicated of <hi>Abraham,</hi> in this very regard, that he was ſet up as the great pattern, according to which God would act towards, and deal with, all that ſhould after believe, or be admitted into a covenant-relation with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf: Hence in this very place the Apoſtle tells us, that faith was reckoned to <hi>Abraham</hi> for righteouſneſs, which is all one as to ſay, righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs was imputed to him through faith, when he was in uncircumciſion, that he might be the Father of the uncircumciſed, that righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs might be imputed to them alſo, <hi>viz.</hi> according to the pattern ſet in <hi>Abraham</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
               <p>So again, <hi>Gal</hi> 3.7. <hi>Even as Abraham believed God, and it was accounted to him for righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</hi> Mark, the deſign of the Apoſtle is to prove, that righteouſneſs is through faith, from the firſt pattern ſet in <hi>Abraham.</hi> Now ſayes he, verſe 7. <hi>Know ye therefore, that they which are of the faith are the children of Abraham;</hi> and then cloſes, verſe 9. <hi>So then they which are of faith, are bleſſed with faithful Abraham;</hi> that is, as they are bleſſed with him with the ſame bleſſings, ſo they are bleſſed with him after the ſame manner, <hi>viz.</hi> through faith. Now as <hi>Abraham</hi> had righteouſneſs imputed to him through faith, that he might be the Father of all that believe, and, as a Father, a pattern to them, in regard of the imputation of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: So he received Circumciſion as a Seal of
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:106624:130"/>that righteouſneſs, that he might be the Father of them that ſhould believe of the circumciſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and, as a Father, a pattern to them, in regard of the uſe and end of Circumciſion, which both he and they in common received: So that it is evident, that (ircumciſion was of that uſe, and appointed for that end, <hi>viz.</hi> to be a Seal of the righteouſneſs of faith, not only to <hi>Abraham</hi> himſelf, but to all his Seed, during the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of that inſtitution.</p>
               <p>Secondly, That Circumciſion was of this uſe, and appointed for this end, with reference to the temporal benefits promiſed in the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, is evident from hence, becauſe it could be of no other uſe, nor appointed for any other end, with reference to ſome of them. Hence I argue, If Circumciſion had ſome reference to the temporal good things promiſed in the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, it was annexed to, and could have no other reference or reſpect but as a Seal, aſſuring the injoyment of them, then that muſt needs be its uſe and end, with reference to thoſe good things promiſed: but the former is true, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the latter.</p>
               <p>The Conſequence in the Major propoſition cannot be denyed, for if Circumciſion had ſome reference to the temporal good things promiſed in the Covenant, and it could have no other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference; but as a Seal or Sign aſſuring the injoy<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ment of them, then that muſt needs be its uſe and end reſpective unto them, this will not be denyed.</p>
               <pb n="234" facs="tcp:106624:131"/>
               <p>Secondly, For the Antecedent, that conſiſts of two branches.</p>
               <p>Firſt, That Circumciſion had ſome reference to, or was of ſome uſe, and appointed for ſome end, reſpective to the temporal good promiſed; this is evident from the indefiniteneſs of the expreſſion, <hi>The Token of my Covenant;</hi> 'twas the Token of the Covenant abſolutely taken, not of ſome part of the Covenant, but of the whole Covenant, and therefore muſt needs in its uſe and end have ſome reference to the whole good promiſed in the Covenant: But this, I ſuppoſe, will be granted by our Oppoſers, they generally affirming, that the ſpecial, if not the only uſe and end of Circumciſion, did refer and relate to the temporal part of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, or to the Covenant as it was a temporal Covenant,</p>
               <p>And therefore ſecondly, That it could have no other reference, or could be of no other uſe, with reference to theſe Promiſes, but only this, <hi>viz.</hi> To ſeal or aſſure the injoyment of the good promiſed: Take it of the Land of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan;</hi> for what uſe, and to what end could Circumciſion be inſtituted, reſpective to that Promiſe, but to ſeal or aſſure the injoyment of the good promiſed, upon condition of the obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the Articles of the Covenant? Whence the Concluſion is undeniable,: So that, I ſay, Circumciſion was the Seal of the whole Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, we ſee it:</p>
               <p>Firſt, In reſpect of the ſpiritual good promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, as pardon of ſin, the righteouſneſs of faith.</p>
               <pb n="235" facs="tcp:106624:131"/>
               <p>Secondly, In reſpect of the temporal good promiſed, and that Circumciſion did ſeal the temporal part of the Covenant, is not only evident from Scripture and Reaſon, but is the general acknowledgment of our Oppoſers them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; therefore I ſhall take it for granted, and upon that Suppoſition infer a third Argument, to prove that it was of that uſe, and appointed for that end, <hi>viz.</hi> To be a Seal, or an aſſuring Sign of the whole good, whether temporall or ſpirituall convey'd, and made over by the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, and conſequently was a Seal of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant abſolutely taken. And therefore,</p>
               <p>Thirdly, If Circumciſion, as the Token of the Covenant, was a Seal of ſome Promiſes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in it, then it was a Seal of all the Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of it: But the former is true, therefore the latter.</p>
               <p>That this Covenant, now entred with <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> and his Seed, was a ſpiritual as well as a temporal Covenant, or did conſiſt of ſpiritual as well as temporal Promiſes, hath been already proved, Now that Circumciſion was the To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of the Covenant, is expreſly affirmed by God himſelf, <hi>This is the Token of my Covenant;</hi> and that as the Token it was of that uſe, and appointed for that end, with reference to the temporal part of the Covenant, hath been before proved, and is granted by our Oppoſers, and therefore muſt needs be of that uſe, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for that end, reſpective to all the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of the Covenant: <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>bi lex non diſting uit
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:106624:132"/>non diſtinguendum eſt,</hi> Let any reaſon be ſhewed why it ſhould not be a Seal, or an aſſuring Sign, of the ſpiritual part of the Covenant, as well as of the temporal part, till which be done, the indefiniteneſs of its reference to the whole Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, expreſt by that indefinite phraſe, <hi>The Token of my Covenant,</hi> is an undoubted warrant to take it, as of the ſame uſe, and appointed for the ſame end, reſpective to all the Promiſes of the Covenant, that it was to any: from all we ſee, that Circumciſion was a Seal, or an aſſuring Sign or Token; and that's the ſecond uſe and end of Circumciſion, the former Token of the Covenant.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The uſe and end of Circumciſion was, to oblige and ingage the perſon receiving of it to keep exactly to the Articles of this Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant; hence is that paſſage, <hi>Jer.</hi> 4.4. <hi>Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſe your ſelves to the Lord:</hi> But this, I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, is granted on all hands, I ſhall not at all ſtand upon it.</p>
               <p>Fourthly and laſtly, The uſe and end of Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion was, to be a viſible badge, to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh the people of God from all other people, and to be a viſible Sign of their covenant-rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or to be a Sign, whereby they did viſibly appear to belong to God in Chriſt, in a contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſtinction from the reſt of the world.</p>
               <p>Secondly, That Baptiſm doth agree with Circumciſion, in regard of theſe uſes and ends,
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:106624:132"/>is ſufficiently evident, and conſequently muſt needs be the Sign and Token of the Covenant here injoyned, ſince the laying aſide of Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion: Let us ſee it in the particulars.</p>
               <p>Firſt, For the firſt uſe and end of Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, <hi>viz.</hi> Its being that ſolemn Rite and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance, by which perſons were admitted into, and incorporated in the Church, or myſtical Body of Chriſt, as viſible: That Baptiſm is of this uſe, and appointed for this end, is expreſly declared by the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.13.</p>
               <p>Secondly, For the ſecond uſe and end of Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion, <hi>viz.</hi> to aſſure the party to whom it was applyed, of the injoyment of the good things, benefits and bleſſings promiſed in the Covenant. That Baptiſm is of this uſe is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently evident from that paſſage of <hi>Peter,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet</hi> 3.21. where <hi>Peter</hi> having ſpoken of the ſalvation of <hi>Noah</hi> and his houſe in the Ark, ſayes he, <hi>The like figure whereunto Baptiſm now ſaveth us,</hi> and telleth us how it ſaveth, both negative<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and poſitively; negatively, it is <hi>not by waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the body from its outward filth,</hi> but poſitive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, by giving or effecting <hi>the anſwer of a good conſcience towards God, through the reſurrection of Chriſt from the dead.</hi> What the Apoſtle means by this anſwer of a good conſcience, Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters are not agreed, neither doth it concern my preſent purpoſe to determine; that which I on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly intend is, that by the reſurrection of Chriſt, through a right uſe and improvement made of
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:106624:133"/>Baptiſm, a believing Soul comes to have a good conſcience, that is, an acquitting conſcience. Now what uſe or improvement can be made of Baptiſm, in order to the cleanſing and purifying the conſcience, by means whereof it becomes good, as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, but as it is looked upon, and applyed as a Seal, or an aſſuring Sign, ſealing and aſſuring to the Soul the remiſſion of ſin, through the purchaſe of Chriſts death, as declared valid and effectual by his riſing from the dead: this uſe and end of Baptiſm is alſo clearly implyed and held forth in the Apoſtles Exhortation to thoſe trembling Jews, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.38. <hi>Repent and be baptized every one of you in the Name of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>for or unto the remiſſion of ſin.</hi> Now under what notion or conſideration doth the Apoſtle exhort to Baptiſm, reſpective to remiſſion of ſin? It cannot be under the notion of a proper cauſe, for Baptiſm is no proper cauſe of the remiſſion of ſin, neither is it ſo much as a neceſſary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, as Faith and Repentance in the adult are, for then none could receive remiſſion of ſin without it; but that is falſe, as is evident in the caſe of the Thief upon the croſs, and the like is the caſe of many others, who are converted immediately before death. Neither doth he exhort to it barely under the notion of a Sign, that phraſe, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, implyes ſome reference that Baptiſm hath to remiſſion of ſin, beyond what it would have, were it only <hi>nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum Signum,</hi> a bare Sign or repreſentation of the remiſſion of ſins by the blood of Chriſt,
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:106624:133"/>and therefore he muſt needs exhort to it under the notion of a Seal or aſſuring Sign: And for the further clearing up of this, let the caſe and condition of theſe trembling Jews be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, as they had ſinned in crucifying of Chriſt, and were under the guilt of that ſin, and under an Obligation to ſuffer deſerved puniſhment, ſo they were under a deep ſence of that their ſin, and that wrath or puniſhment due to them up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the account thereof. Now as the Apoſtle ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horts them to repent (with which a ſaving faith in Chriſt muſt be ſuppoſed to concur) with a direct reference to their obtaining remiſſion of ſin, <hi>in foro Dei;</hi> ſo he exhorts them to be bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized, with a peculiar reference to the pacifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their conſciences, that they might not only have remiſſion of ſin in the Court of Heaven, but have that remiſſion ſealed and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed to them, to the quieting their afflicted conſciences, or to the working in them good conſciences: But that is a ſecond uſe and end of Baptiſm.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, For the third uſe and end of Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion, <hi>viz.</hi> To oblige and ingage the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to whom it was applyed, to a due and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful performance of all conſequent duties requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in the Covenant. This is true alſo of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm; Baptiſm is not only a ſealing or confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Sign, but an obliging Sign, by it the perſon baptized is obliged to take God in Chriſt for his God, and give up himſelf to him, in univerſal and conſtant obedience to his will: This is
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:106624:134"/>clearly held forth in that Propoſition <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm is ſaid to be, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>Into the Name of the Father,</hi> Matth. 28.19. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>Into Chriſt,</hi> Gal. 3.27. But this, <hi>I</hi> ſuppoſe, will be granted on all hands, <hi>I</hi> need not ſtand upon it.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, For the laſt uſe and end of Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion, <hi>viz.</hi> To be an outward Sign or badge of that covenant-relation the Soul was taken into with God in Chriſt, whereby the perſon was known and taken notice of, as vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly belonging unto God, as one of his cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant-people. This again is true of Baptiſm; hence thoſe that are baptized are ſaid to put on Chriſt, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.27. <hi>As many as were baptized in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Chriſt have put on Chriſt,</hi> they viſibly appear as Members of his myſtical Body, as contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſtinguiſhed from the non-baptized; from all it evidently appears, that Baptiſm is indeed that Ordinance, appointed by our Lord Chriſt under the new Teſtament, ſerving to, and performing of thoſe uſes and ends, with reference unto which, a Sign or Token in the general was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed to the Covenant eſtabliſhed between God and <hi>Abraham,</hi> and his Seed in their Generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. But let that ſuffice for the fourth parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, That this Command doth alike oblige believing Gentiles, reſpective to Baptiſm, that it did the Jews, reſpective to Circumciſion. As it obliged the Jews, during that firſt Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:106624:134"/>adminiſtration, to be circumciſed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and ſee that their Infant ſeed were cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed with them; ſo it doth ſtill oblige be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving Parents to be baptized themſelves, and ſee that their Infant-ſeed be baptized with them: This is evident from the conſideration of two things in the Command.</p>
               <p>Firſt, The extenſiveneſs of it; it reaches <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Seed in their Generations, as we have afore proved.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The applicability of it, as more generally laid down to Baptiſm, as well as to Circumciſion: And for the clearing up of this, let it be carefully obſerved, that the Command obliging <hi>Abraham,</hi> and his Seed in their Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations, to keep the Covenant, meaning as before noted, the Token of the Covenant, did not at all intimate, much leſs determine, what that Token ſhould be; it only conſtitutes the general duty of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and his Seed in their Generations, reſpective to the Token of the Covenant, whatever that ſhould after be deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined by God himſelf to be: the words are plain and expreſs, <hi>Thou ſhalt keep my Covenant, thou and thy Seed after thee in their Generations;</hi> not thou and thy Seed ſhall be circumciſed or baptized, but thou and thy Seed in their Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations ſhall keep the Covenant: Hence the Command, as thus generally laid down, obligeth no more to the application or reception of cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion, than to the application or reception
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:106624:135"/>of Baptiſm, and indeed to neither of them, ſimply and abſolutely conſidered; it only enjoyned the application and reception of the Token of the Covenant, but did not determine what that was, or ſhould be; and had God only thus generally and indefinitely commanded the keeping of the Covenant, without ſpecifying what this Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant ſhould be, for <hi>Abraham</hi> himſelf to have been circumciſed, or to have circumciſed his Seed, had been a Sin, and an act of will-worſhip: but now when God had determined Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to be the then Token of the Covenant, this general Command was to be applyed by him to that inſtitution in particular, and his receiving of it himſelf, and applying it to his Seed, was warranted, yea, injoyned by this Command; ſo then that particular inſtitution of Circumciſion was laid aſide, and Baptiſm inſtituted for the ſame uſes &amp; ends: that Command was no longer to be applyed to Circumciſion, but unto Baptiſm ſet up in the ſtead of it; and doth equally ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige Chriſtians to the application and reception of Baptiſm, as it did the Jews, during the firſt Teſtament adminiſtration, to the application and reception of Circumciſion; the command only injoyning the obſervation of the Token of the Covenant, not determining what that was or ſhould be; as it injoyned of it ſelf neither Circumciſion nor Baptiſm, ſo it inioyned both the one and the other, as they were determined by God to be the Token of his Covenant; ſo that we have as an expreſs command, comparing this command with that, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.19. for
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:106624:135"/>baptiſme of Infants, as the Jews had for the circumciſing their Infant-ſeed; The command to keep the Covenant lying upon <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Seed in their Generations, which, as I have ſaid, as it injoyned Parents to receive or have the Token of the Covenant applyed unto them, and unto their Infant-ſeed, ſo it conſtituted it to be a duty of the Infant-ſeed of Believers, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive and bear the Token as applyed unto them. So that what would we have more, indeed what can be more plainly ſpoken: would we have had God ſaid, thou ſhalt keep my Covenant, thou and thy Seed after thee in their Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Circumciſion before the Meſſiah come, and Baptiſm after.</p>
               <p>I, you will ſay, had it been ſo expreſt it would have prevented this controverſie.</p>
               <p>But to what purpoſe ſhould it have been ſo expreſt? Is it not all one, <hi>Thou ſhalt keep my Covenant therefore, thou and thy Seed in their Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations,</hi> not determining what Covenant ſhould be kept, and then for God firſt to inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute Circumciſion as the Token of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and then lay that aſide, and ſubſtitute Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm in the room of it; the command ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining in its full force, without the leaſt inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of a repeal: is not the command ſtill legible, and is it not plain enough, it lyes upon <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Seed in their Generations? And is it not evident, that believing Gentiles are <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>'s Seed? And is it not plainly expreſt, that Baptiſm is the preſent Token of the Covenant, as Circumciſion of old was? So that if we will
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:106624:136"/>not call for a command, and when it is brought ſhut our eyes againſt it, here we have as an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs command for the baptiſm of the Infant-ſeed of believing Parents, as the Jews had for the circumciſing their Infant-ſeed.</p>
               <p>But yet for the further explanation, illuſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and confirmation of what I have in this particular aſſerted, let two things be obſerved.</p>
               <p>Firſt, How the Lord doth vary the phraſe, when he comes to ſpecifie the Covenant then to be kept; 'tis not ſaid, This is my Covenant which thou and thy Seed in their Generations ſhall keep, but, <hi>This is my Covenant which</hi> ye <hi>ſhall keep between me and</hi> you, <hi>every man-child among</hi> you <hi>ſhall be circumciſed, and</hi> you <hi>ſhall circumciſe the fleſh of</hi> your <hi>fore-skin, and it ſhall be a token of the Covenant between me and</hi> you, verſe 10, 11. So again verſe 12. <hi>He that is eight dayes old ſhall be circumciſed among</hi> you, <hi>every man-child in your Generations.</hi> A plain intimation, that he purpoſed a change in the Token of the Covenant, and that Circumciſion ſhould continue the Token of it, only during the firſt Teſtament adminiſtration, while the Covenant it ſelf was to be continued in an eſpecial manner in <hi>Abraham</hi>'s natural loin and poſterity.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Let it be obſerved, That this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand ſtands not alone in regard of this inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation we have put upon it, but hath its pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel: there are other commands in the old
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:106624:136"/>Teſtament that muſt be neceſſarily interpreted and underſtood after the ſame manner.</p>
               <p>I ſhall give you a twofold inſtance in the commands of the Moral Law.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Take an inſtance in the ſecond Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment, <hi>Thou ſhalt not make to thy ſelf any graven Image.</hi> Now will any ſay, that this Command is only negative, doth only prohibit groſs Idolatry, according to the letter of the command. Surely 'tis agreed on all hands, that it requires ſomething poſitive, <hi>viz.</hi> That the external worſhip that God himſelf appoints, be exactly obſerved and performed, according to the way and manner himſelf hath determin'd in his Word; and thus when God had appointed and eſtabliſhed that worſhip, conſiſting in ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, obſervation of dayes, and the like, in and by which his people, under the firſt Teſtament, were to worſhip and ſerve him, that command was to be applied to that kind of worſhip, and did require the exact obſervation and perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance thereof, according to the way and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner declared by God himſelf. But now then that kind of worſhip was laid aſide, and other Ordinances and Inſtitutions appointed, in and by which the people of God were and are to worſhip and ſerve him: the Command is of alike authority as before, and doth alike oblige and bind the people of God, to the exact obſervation and performance of that worſhip now eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, according to the way and manner declared in the Word, as it did oblige and bind the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:106624:137"/>of God, under the firſt Teſtament, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to the worſhip then eſtabliſhed: Though there be an alteration and change made in the particular Ordinances and Inſtitutions, in and by which God will have worſhip tender'd up to him; yet the Command, as more generally laid down, as requiring the exact obſervation and performance of whatever worſhip is of Gods own inſtitution, is of the ſame authority and force that ever it was; though it doth not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige us generally to the ſame acts of worſhip that it did oblige the Jews unto, yet it equally obligeth us to thoſe acts and duties now pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed by God, as it did the Jews to that wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip preſcribed unto them: The Command, as more generally propoſed, doth not ſpecifie any paticular acts or duties, in and by which God would be worſhipped, it only requires in the general, that whatever act or duty God himſelf appoints, be exactly obſerved and performed, and that according to the way and manner de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared by himſelf: the very ſame is the caſe of this Command, injoyning the keeping of the Covenant. The Command, as I have ſaid, as thus generally propoſed, ſpecifies not what that Covenant is or ſhould be, only requires the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication and reception of the Token of the Covenant, and conſequently to Circumciſion, when that was appointed as the Token of the Covenant, and during its continuance; but upon the ceſſation of that, to Baptiſme, as that Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance which God hath declared to be the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Token of the Covenant.</p>

               <p>Secondly, Take another Inſtance in the fourth Commandment, <hi>Remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy.</hi> Here is a Command more generally laid down, injoyning the keeping ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Sabbath or reſt-day, not ſpecifying which day ſhould be that reſt-day. Now when the Seventh day was inſtituted as that day of reſt, this general Command was to be applyed to that particular day, and did require the keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of that day holy; but when the Seventh day was laid aſide, and another day, <hi>viz.</hi> The firſt day of the week, inſtituted by Chriſt as that reſt day; now that Command, as ſo gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally propoſed, is to be applied to this particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar day, and equally obligeth us Chriſtians to the keeping holy the firſt day of the week, as it did the Jews to keep holy the ſeventh; hence we have no expreſs command in the new Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament for the keeping holy the firſt day of the week, neither is there any need there ſhould that command, to remember the day day of reſt, and keep it holy, being equally applicable to one day as to another, and God having determined the day, the command is to be applyed unto it as ſo determined by God; which again is the very caſe of this command, under conſideration; it determines not the Covenant to be kept, but requires that the Covenant, whatever God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termines it to be, be kept, and conſequently as it firſt obliged to the application and reception of Circumciſion, ſo now it obligeth to the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication and reception of Baptiſm.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>The ſecond and third Argument, for the confirmation of the laſt ſubordinate Propoſition, propoſed and managed. The ſeveral Inſtances of Houſholds being baptized, conſidered.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>
                  <hi>The ſecond Argument.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>IF the Infant-ſeed of believing Parents were in primitive times baptized, either by the Apoſtles themſelves, or by any others by their allowance, direction, or approbation, then it was or ſtill is according to the will of Chriſt, that they ſhould be baptized: But the former is true, therefore the latter. The conſequence in the Major propoſition will be readily granted on all hands. That which alone needs proof is this, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Infant-ſeed of believing Parents were in primitive times, either by the Apoſtles themſelves, or by others, by their allowance, direction or approbation baptized. For the confirmation of which this one Argument may ſuffice.</p>
               <p>If the Infant-ſeed of believing Parents were by the Apoſtles owned and looked upon, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaining to, or as Members of the myſtical Body of Chriſt, as viſible, then they were, either by themſelves, or by others, by their allowance,
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:106624:139"/>direction and approbation, admitted and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planted into that Body by Baptiſm: But the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant-ſeed of believing Parents were owned and looked upon by the Apoſtles, as before expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed: <hi>Ergo, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here again the Conſequence in the Major propoſition will be, I ſuppoſe, readily granted by our Oppoſers, and 'tis ſufficiently evident by this Argument.</p>
               <p>If Baptiſm was appointed by Chriſt, for the ſolemn admiſſion of ſuch into his myſtical Body, as viſible, as did appertain thereunto, or were Members thereof, and there was no other way or means appointed for the ſame end and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, then all that the Apoſtles did own and look upon, as appertaining to, or as Members of that Body, were, either by the Apoſtles themſelves, or by others, by their allowance, direction and approbation, admitted and implanted into it by Baptiſm: But the former is true, therefore the latter; the Minor here alone needs proof, and that conſiſts of theſe two branches.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>Firſt, That Baptiſm was appointed by Chriſt, for the ſolemn admiſſion and implantation of ſuch into his myſtical Body, as viſible, as did appertain thereunto, or were Members there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</item>
                  <item>Secondly, That there is no other way or means appointed by Chriſt for that end and purpoſe.</item>
               </list>
               <p>Firſt, For the firſt, ſee 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.13. <hi>For by one Spirit we are all baptized into one Body, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we be Jews or Gentiles, whether we be bond
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:106624:139"/>or free, and have been all made to drink into one Spirit.</hi> What may be objected from this Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture againſt the baptiſm of Infants, ſhall be taken notice of by and by. All that I cite it at preſent for is, to prove, that Baptiſm was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by Chriſt, for the ſolemn admiſſion of perſons into his Body, as viſible, which is ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently evident.</p>
               <p>Secondly, That there is no other way or means appointed by Chriſt, for the ſolemn admiſſion of any into his viſible myſtical Body: If any ſhall ſay there is, let them ſhew it and prove from Scripture what they affirm, and I ſhall readily grant the invalidity of this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; but that doubtleſs none will attempt to do, ſo that the truth of the Major propoſition is unqueſtionable,</p>
               <p>For the Minor, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Infant-feed of believing Parents were owned and looked upon by the Apoſtles, as appertaining to, or as Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the myſtical Body of Chriſt, as viſible, This will be denyed, and therefore muſt be proved, and I ſhall prove it by theſe two Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, both which being grounded upon expreſs and poſitive Scriptures, will render the addition of more wholly needleſs.</p>
               <p>Firſt, All thoſe who were by the Apoſtle owned and looked upon, and that as perſonally or particularly conſidered, as the actual Subjects of the Promiſe of Salvation, were owned and looked upon by them, as appertaining to, or as Members of the myſtical Body of Chriſt, as viſible: But the Infant-ſeed of believing Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:106624:140"/>were owned and looked upon by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, and that as perſonally and particularly conſidered, as the actual Subjects of the Promiſe of Salvation, therefore they were owned and looked upon by them, as appertaining to, or as Members of the myſtical Body of Chriſt, as viſible.</p>
               <p>The Minor propoſition hath been already proved; and as for the Major, that is evident thus, Chriſt is the Saviour of his body, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.23. Now to be under a Promiſe of Salvation, is to be under a Promiſe of being ſaved by Chriſt: hence all that are under a Promiſe of being ſaved by Chriſt, muſt needs appertain to, or be of his myſtical body, for 'tis of his Body that he is the Saviour.</p>
               <p>But two things will be objected.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> 1. Firſt, That Chriſt is ſaid to be the Saviour of all men, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.10. To be the Saviour of the world, <hi>John</hi> 4.42. and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore though it ſhould be granted, that the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant-ſeed of believing Parents are under the Promiſe of being ſaved by Chriſt, it will not follow, that they were looked upon as apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining to, or as Members of his myſtical Body.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> To that I anſwer, that though Chriſt in a large ſence may be, and is in Scripture ſaid to be the Saviour of all men, and the Saviour of the world, yet no particular or individual perſon is actually, and that for the preſent, as perſonally conſidered under any Promiſe of being ſaved by him, (eſpecially taking Salvation of ſpiritual
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:106624:140"/>and eternal Salvation) but ſuch who are of, or do appertain to his myſtical Body: therefore it is ſaid of theſe <hi>Epheſians,</hi> before their imbrace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Chriſt, <hi>They were ſtrangers to the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants of promiſe,</hi> Epheſ. 2.12, They had nothing to do with the Promiſes of ſpiritual and ſaving Mercies; and as they were ſtrangers to the Covenants of promiſe, ſo they were without hope, without any grounded hope, intereſt in the Promiſes being the alone true ground of all hope of ſpiritual and eternal Salvation: ſo that intereſt in the Promiſe of Salvation, declares the perſons ſo intereſſed, to appertain to, or to be of the myſtical Body of Chriſt, all others being ſtrangers to the Promiſes, and therefore without hope.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> 2, Secondly, It is objected, That when it is ſaid, Chriſt is the Saviour of his Body, it is only meant of his myſtical body as inviſible, and conſequently, in caſe this Scripture will prove, that the Infant-ſeed of believing Parents, as having the Promiſe of Salvation appertaining to them, do appertain to the myſtical Body of Chriſt, it will prove, that they do univerſally appertain to his Myſtical Body, as inviſible, which it will be ſaid we our ſelves deny, and therefore this Scripture is impertinently brought to prove their relation to the myſtical Body of Chriſt, as viſible, which only ſpeaks of his myſtical Body, as inviſible.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> To that I anſwer, This Objection will receive a more full anſwer by and by, where I ſhall meet with it again: at preſent I ſhall only
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:106624:141"/>ſay, 'tis evident the Apoſtle ſpeaks of the myſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Body of Chriſt, as viſible, and not meerly as inviſible; for let it be obſerved, that Body and Church, in this diſcourſe of the Apoſtle, are Synonimies, or words exactly anſwering one another in ſence and ſignification: whom he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends by Body he intends by Church, and ſo on the other hand, whom he intends by Church he intends by Body: Now this Church or Body of Chriſt, of which he is ſaid here to be the Saviour, was that Church or Body, of which the <hi>Epheſians</hi> were an homogeneal Part, that is, a part of the ſame kind with the whole; hence the Apoſtle ſpeaks of them, as joynt Members with himſelf of this Body, verſe 20. for we are Members of his Body, of his fleſh, and of his bones. Mark, he takes in the <hi>Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians</hi> univerſally and indefinitely, one as well as another, as joynt Members with him of this Body: So <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.19. <hi>Now therefore ye are no longer Strangers and Forreigners, but fellow-Citizens with the Saints, and of the Houſhold of God.</hi> To be fellow-Citizens with the Saints, and of the Houſhold of God, is all one with be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this Church or Body. Now it is evident, the Apoſtle did not ſuppoſe, that every indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pual perſon of this Church were Members of the inviſible Body of Chriſt; what he ſaith, <hi>Acts</hi> 20 30. plainly declares the contrary. Now then this Church or Body, of which the Apoſtle ſaith, Chriſt was the Head and Saviour, being that Church or Body, of which the <hi>Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians</hi> were an homogeneal part, and they not
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:106624:141"/>being ſuppoſed by the Apoſtle univerſally to appertain to the Church or Body of Chriſt, as inviſible; It will undoubtedly follow, that he doth not ſpeak of the Church or Body of Chriſt meerly as inviſible, but as viſible. Chriſt is in Scripture ſaid to be the Saviour of his Church or Body, as viſibly conſidered, and the Infant-ſeed of believing Parents being under a Promiſe of Salvation by him, or of being ſaved by him, they muſt needs by the Apoſtles be owned and looked upon, as Members of that Body of which he is the Saviour, none, as I have ſaid, being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a Promiſe of being ſaved by him, but ſuch as do appertain to that Body, of which he is the Saviour.</p>
               <p>Secondly, All thoſe who under the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel adminiſtration, and that as perſonally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, are the actual Subjects of that Promiſe, wherein God ingaged himſelf to be a God to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and his Seed in their Generations, were owned and looked upon by the Apoſtles, as appertaining to, or as Members of the myſtical Body of Chriſt, as viſible: But the Infant ſeed of believing Parents under the Goſpel admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration, and that as perſonally conſidered, are the actual Subjects of that Promiſe; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Major is undeniably proved, by that poſitive Aſſertion of the Apoſtle, <hi>Galatians</hi> 3.16. <hi>Now to Abraham and his Seed were the Promiſes made; he ſaith not, to is Seeds, as of many, but to thy Seed, which is Chriſt;</hi> that is, Chriſt myſtical. Now if that Promiſe were
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:106624:142"/>made to Chriſt, and to Chriſt only, as we ſee the Apoſtle denyes it to be made to any other, it was not made to Seeds, but to Seed, to thy Seed, which, ſaith the Apoſtle, is Chriſt. I ſay, if this Promiſe was made only to Chriſt, it will unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niably follow, that whoſoever that Promiſe was made unto, or to whom that Promiſe may by Scripture-warrant be applyed, as the Actual Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of it, and that as perſonally conſidered, they muſt needs by the Apoſtles be looked upon and owned, as appertaining to, or as Members of the myſtical Body of Chriſt, and therefore let none evade this plain evidence, to the deceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves or others, by ſaying, that there are Promiſes made to others, that are not Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the myſtical Body of Chriſt. Let it be remembred, the Argument ſpeaks not of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes in the general, nor of any kind of Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, but of this Promiſe in ſpecial; nor doth it ſpeak of this Promiſe, as an indefinite Promiſe made to any ſort or ſpecies of perſons, collective<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly taken, where <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> ſingle or individual perſon can be ſaid to be an actual Subject of it, as per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonally conſidered; and therefore ſo produce any ſuch Inſtances is wholly impertinent: as to the Argument in hand, let it be ſhewed, that any perſon, whether old or young, might ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Scripture be accounted an actual Subject of this Promiſe, and that as perſonally conſidered, who yet was not by the Apoſtles owned or looked upon, as appertaining to, or as a Member of the myſtical Body of Chriſt, till which be done, which I ſhall not doubt to affirm
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:106624:142"/>is impoſſible to be done) we may undoubtedly conclude, that all thoſe that are the actual Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of that Promiſe, as perſonally conſidered, were owned and looked upon by the Apoſtles, as appertaining to, or as Members of the myſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Body of Chriſt, which is the thing affirmed in our Major propoſition. For the Minor pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Infant-ſeed of believing Parents are, under the Goſpel adminiſtration, ſuch Subjects of that Promiſe; this hath been already fully proved; whence our Concluſion is undeniable, That they were owned and look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon by the Apoſtles, as appertaining to, or as Members of the myſtical Body of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> But it will be ſaid, That by Chriſt here we are to underſtand Chriſt myſtical, as inviſible, and not as viſible. The Promiſes are made to Chriſt, that is, to the real and internal Members of his myſtical Body.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> To that I ſhall anſwer theſe two things.</p>
               <p>Firſt. <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>bi Lex non diſtinguit, non diſtinguen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum eſt,</hi> Where the Law diſtinguiſheth not we are not to diſtinguiſh. Now the Apoſtle tells us, the Promiſes are made to Chriſt; not to Chriſt, either under this or that notion or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration; here is no diſtinction between Chriſt, as viſible or inviſible, but ſimply and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely, the Promiſe is to thy Seed, which is Chriſt.</p>
               <p>But you will ſay, Though the Apoſtle doth nor here diſtinguiſh, yet the Scripture elſewhere
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:106624:143"/>warrants that diſtinction; and it is certain, the Promiſes do not really appertain to any, but ſuch as have a real union with, and intereſt in Chriſt, of whom his Body, as inviſible is conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted and made up, therefore we are to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the Apoſtle, as intending only the inviſible Body of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>To that I anſwer, It is granted, that in order to a due application of this or any other Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe to our ſelves, and in order to our enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the good promiſed, we muſt not only look to a viſible profeſſion of Chriſt, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutes us of his Body, as viſible, but we are to look to the reallity of our union with, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in him. But yet let it be carefully ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, that the Scripture preſumes and takes it for granted, that as to particular perſons, thoſe who do viſibly belong to Chriſt, are of his Body, as inviſibly, as well as viſibly conſidered: Hence in all that it ſpeaks to, or of the Body of Chriſt, it ſpeaks to or of it, ſimply or abſolutely, as his Body, without diſtinguiſhing of it as viſible or inviſible. And let it be further carefully ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, that that diſtinction of Seeds intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the Apoſtle, whereof ſome have the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes made to them, and others not, doth not reſpect the Members of the Body of Chriſt, as viſible, as though ſome of them had the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes made to them, in a contradiction from others, viſibly of the ſame Body, who have not the Promiſes made unto them, but the diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is either between ſuch, who might plead an intereſt in the Promiſes as related to <hi>Abraham,</hi> as
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:106624:143"/>his natural Children, who yet cleaved to the Law for Righteouſneſs and Life: Or between ſuch, who though in word they did profeſs Faith in Chriſt, yet did indeed fall in with, and imbrace ſuch doctrines and practices as did, <hi>ipſo facto,</hi> forfeit and diſanul their right of member<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip in the myſtical body of Chriſt, as viſible, and ſuch who did viſibly adhere and cleave to Chriſt in faith and obedience, in oppoſition to the imbracement or falling in with any ſuch do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines or practices. Now the Apoſtle affirms, that to theſe, and not to thoſe, the Promiſe was made. Indeed this I ſhall readily grant, that the holy Ghoſt would have all to know, that if any, while they keep up a viſible profeſſion of Chriſt, and of adhearing alone to him in faith and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, ſhould yet act ſhort of, or contrary to that their profeſſion, it was not their meer pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion that would give them the actual poſſeſſion of the good promiſed, they muſt act according to their profeſſion, otherwiſe though the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, as externally promulgated and declared, are made to them, and they in <hi>foro Eccleſiae</hi> had a right to them, yet it was none of the intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God, that upon the terms of a bare profeſſion they ſhould enjoy the good promiſed; but this I ſay, that the Promiſes, in reſpect of the external promulgation and declaration of them, are made to Chriſt myſtical, without conſideration had to that diſtinction of viſible and inviſible; the Holy Ghoſt ſpeaking to or of then, by men ſpeaks according to what viſibly appear of them.</p>
               <pb n="260" facs="tcp:106624:144"/>
               <p>But ſecondly, I anſwer, That Chriſt here muſt needs be underſtood of Chriſt myſtical, as viſibly conſidered: This hath been touched up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on already, and for further ſatisfaction, ſee Mr. <hi>Gobbett</hi> in his <hi>Juſt Vindication,</hi> page 57. and it evidently appears from hence, becauſe particular and individual perſons might ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily be known to appertain to, and be Members of Chriſt, as here ſpoken of by the Apoſtle. Now no individual or particular perſon can be ordinarily known to appertain to Chriſt, or to be a Member of him, as inviſibly conſidered; ſee verſe 28. where ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Ye are all one in Chriſt;</hi> the Apoſtle ſpeaks to the <hi>Galati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> and ſaith he, <hi>Ye are all one in Chriſt;</hi> and in ſaying they were all one in Chriſt, he muſt needs acknowledge them to be all in Chriſt; how could they be all one in Chriſt, unleſs they were in Chriſt? But ſure none will ſuppoſe, that the Apoſtle did infallibly know them, to have been univerſally every individual perſon among them of the Body of Chriſt, as inviſible, therefore he muſt needs ſpeak of Chriſt here as viſible, and not meerly as inviſible, and beſides, let the foregoing Arguments, to prove that the Infant-ſeed of believing Parents, and that as ſuch, are included as the actual Subjects of this Promiſe, be well weighed, which ſuppoſing it to be true, it will undeniably follow, that the Apoſtle here ſpeaks of the myſtical Body of Chriſt, as viſible, in as much as the Infant-ſeed of believing Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents may then be ordinarily known to apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to Chriſt, as here ſpoken of by the Apoſtle.</p>
               <pb n="261" facs="tcp:106624:144"/>
               <p>And therefore whereas our Oppoſers affirm, That Chriſt here is to be underſtood of Chriſt myſtical, as inviſible, and thereupon conclude, that the Infant-ſeed of believing Parents can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not, as ſuch, be ſuppoſed to appertain unto Chriſt, and conſequently not included as Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of that Promiſe, ſaid by our Apoſtle to be made unto Chriſt.</p>
               <p>We on the other hand affirm, and I hope have ſufficiently proved, that they are included as joynt Subjects with their Parents of that Promiſe, and upon that ground ought to be look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon as appertaining to Chriſt, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently that by Chriſt here we are to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand Chriſt myſtical as viſible, and not meerly as inviſible.</p>
               <p>Now unleſs our Oppoſers ſhall produce clearer evidence, that the Apoſtle doth indeed ſpeak of the myſtical Body of Chriſt, meerly as inviſible, then hath been produced, to prove the Infant-ſeed of believing Parents, and that as ſuch, to be included in that Promiſe, we ſhall take it for granted, that he ſpeaks of Chriſt as viſible, &amp; that the Infant-ſeed of believing Parents do apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to, or are Members of his myſtical Body as viſible, and conſequently, <hi>Quod erat demonſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum,</hi> were either by the Apoſtles themſelves, or by ſome others, by their allowance, direction or approbation, admitted and implanted into that Body by Baptiſm.</p>
               <p>Now as a cloſe of this Argument, it may not be altogether unſeaſonable to ſhew in a few words (it needs not many) what reſpect we
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:106624:145"/>have to that myſtical Relation, wherein the Infant-ſeed of believing Parents ſtand towards <hi>Abraham,</hi> as his Seed, in the application of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm unto them, the conſideration of which I afore referred to the handling of this laſt Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, and I know not where to touch upon it ſo ſeaſonably as here.</p>
               <p>And for this let it be noted, that in the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of Baptiſm we have a direct and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary reſpect to their ſtate, as joynt Subjects with their Parents of the Promiſes of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, the Covenant and Promiſes thereof be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing entred with, and made unto <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Seed in their Generations, as with and to the Parents perſonally conſidered, ſo with and to their Seed, as ſuch: Hence both Parents and Seed are to have the Token of the Covenant applyed unto them, they being joynt Subjects of the ſame Covenant and Promiſes, they are alike to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of the Sign and Token of the Covenant: Hence look what reſpect we have to the myſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Relation of believing Parents to <hi>Abraham,</hi> in the application of Baptiſm unto them, the ſame reſpect we have to the myſtical Relation of their Infant ſeed to <hi>Abraham,</hi> in the applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Baptiſm unto them.</p>
               <p>The third Argument: If intereſt in that grand Promiſe of the Covenant, wherein God ingaged to be a God to <hi>Abraham</hi> and his Seed in their Generations, be alone and by it ſelf a ſufficient ground, upon which perſons may and ought to be exhorted and moved unto Baptiſm,
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:106624:145"/>then all thoſe, who have an intereſt in that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, may and ought to be baptized: But inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt in that Promiſe is alone and by it ſelf a ſufficient ground, upon which perſons may and ought to be exhorted and moved unto Baptiſm: therefore all thoſe, who have an intereſt in that Promiſe, and conſequently Infants they having an intereſt in it, may and ought to be bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed.</p>
               <p>The Conſequence in the Major Propoſition of this Proſyllogiſm cannot be denied; for if a Miniſter may exhort or move one to be baptized upon this ſole ground, that he hath an intereſt in that Promiſe, he may and ought to apply Baptiſm to him upon that ſole ground; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe perſons might be duly exhorted to a duty, which would be unlawful for them to practice, which would be abſurd.</p>
               <p>Therefore 'tis the Minor only which, I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, will be denyed, which yet, I judge, will be granted by the major part of our Oppoſers; and for the ſatisfaction of others, let theſe two Scriptures be compared together, and well weighed, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.9. <hi>Acts</hi> 2.38, 39 ſaith God to <hi>Abraham, Thou ſhalt keep my Covenant, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thou and thy Seed in their Generations:</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Repent and be baptized every one of you for the remiſſion of ſin, fir the Promiſe is to you and to your Children.</hi> Now let it be dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently obſerved, how the Holy Ghoſt grounds the Command or Exhortation to keep the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, that is, the Token of the Covenant, upon intereſt in, and right to the Promiſes of the
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:106624:146"/>Covenant, <hi>I will be thy God,</hi> ſaith the Lord to Abraham, <hi>and the God of thy Seed in their Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, thou ſhalt keep my Covenant therefore, thou and thy Seed in their Generations.</hi> Now to what end or purpoſe can it be imagined, that the Command to keep the Covenant ſhould be uſhered in with a <hi>therefore,</hi> had not the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand ſome reference to the Promiſes immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately afore propoſed? And what reference can it be imagined to have but this, that Gods vouchſafement of theſe Promiſes was the ground and foundation of the Command? The Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand was given upon no other account or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lideration, but their intereſt in the foregoing Promiſes, and the uſe the thing commanded ſhould be of to them, reſpective to theſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, ſo that I ſay, the Command is grounded upon their intereſt in the Promiſes; having theſe Promiſes, <hi>Thou ſhalt therefore keep my Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant:</hi> In like manner the Apoſtle grounds his Exhortation to Baptiſm, the preſent Token of the Covenant, or enforceth it by the conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of right to, and intereſt in the Promiſe, be baptized, for <hi>the Promiſe is unto you:</hi> And that the truth of what we affirm may more fully appear, let us enquire into two things.</p>
               <p>Firſt, What Promiſe it was the Apoſtle ſaith was <hi>unto them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, What the meaning of the Apoſtle is in theſe words, <hi>The Promiſe is to you.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="265" facs="tcp:106624:146"/>
               <p>Firſt, For the firſt, And thus the Promiſe here ſaid by the Apoſtle to be unto them, muſt needs be ſome Promiſe, which is common to all that are called of God, and yet peculiar and proper to them and their Children: hence it could not be either the Promiſe of ſending Chriſt, or the Promiſe of the extraordinary gift of the Spirit; for as the former is not proper and peculiar to ſuch as God calls, ſo the latter is not common to them all, and therefore it muſt needs be either that grand Promiſe of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, or ſome other of the eſſence and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the Covenant, as remiſſion of ſin, or the like, which is all one as to our preſent pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</p>
               <p>Secondly, For the ſecond, And thus I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe all parties muſt neceſſarily and anſwerably do concenter in one of theſe two interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, either that the Apoſtles meaning is, that the Promiſe was to them, ſo as that they had a preſent actual and perſonal intereſt in it, which ſeems moſt agreeable to the letter of the words; or elſe that at preſent the Promiſe was to them only, by way of offer and tender, but would be unto them, ſo as that they ſhould have an actual and perſonal intereſt in it, upon the Lords cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of them, or which is all one, upon their repentance; and that the Apoſtle doth eye and intend their perſonal intereſt in the Promiſe, either as at preſent, according to the firſt ſenſe of the words, or future, to be obtained by their repentance, according to the latter, is evident; becauſe otherwiſe the having of the Promiſe
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:106624:147"/>to them, would have been no ſufficient ground for the Apoſtles Exhortation to Baptiſm neither could he rationally make it a motive to them to be baptized; ſo that according to the latter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation of the Apoſtles words, 'tis as if he ſhould ſay, the Promiſe is to you by way of offer and tender at preſent, therefore repent, whereby you ſhall have an actual intereſt in it, and thereupon be baptized; and that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle exhorts to Repentance only, and not both to Baptiſm and Repentance, in order to their having an actual intereſt in the Promiſe, is paſt all doubt, in as much as Baptiſm muſt neceſſarily follow upon, and not precede intereſt in the Promiſe, as a means either by it ſelf, or as a joynt means with Repentance, to obtain that intereſt; ſo that, I ſay, his meaning muſt be this, repent, that you may have an intereſt in the Promiſe, and upon your repentance be baptized for the remiſſion of ſin, for then the Promiſe is to you, that is, you then will have an actual right to, and intereſt in it: So that take the meaning of the Apoſtle which way you will, it is all one as to my Preſent purpoſe, in as much as he grounds his Exhortation to Baptiſm upon actual intereſt in the Promiſe, or makes that the motive to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite and ſtir them up to Baptiſm: now intereſt in the Promiſe being the ground upon which, or the motive by which the Apoſtle preſſeth them to Baptiſm, it muſt needs be a ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent ground for the application of Baptiſm; and conſequently whoever hath an intereſt in the Promiſe may duly and rightly have Baptiſme applyed unto them.</p>
               <pb n="267" facs="tcp:106624:147"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> But it will be objected, The Apoſtle conjoyns Repentance and Baptiſme in his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation, and therefore they cannot be ſeparated in practice.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. To that I anſwer two things.</p>
               <p>Firſt, That though the Apoſtle conjoyns theſe two duties in his Exhortation, yea, though he ſhould ground his Exhortation to the practice of them both upon the ſame foundation, <hi>viz.</hi> intereſt in and right to the Promiſe; yet that doth not neceſſarily imply an inſeparable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion between them in practice, two duites may be conjoyned in an Exhortation, and both moved to upon one and the ſame ground, and yet be ſeparable in their practice, and then either of theſe duties may be preſſed to and anſwerably practiced apart upon that ground, let us ſee it in theſe two duties of Repentance and Baptiſm, exhorted to by the Apoſtle: it is evident the Apoſtle exhorts to theſe two duties, with refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to two diſtinct ends; the one, <hi>viz.</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, with reference to their obtaining an actual intereſt in the Promiſe, ſuppoſe that were wanting, or with reference to the removal of a ſpecial bar, which at preſent lay in the way of their Baptiſm, ſuppoſing them to have a preſent intereſt in it: The other, <hi>viz.</hi> Baptiſm, with reference to the confirmation of their faith in, or their aſſurance of their enjoyment of the good promiſed, upon ſuppoſition of a precedent intereſt in the Promiſe. Now when theſe two ends are ſeparated, as in reſpect of many they may be, ſometimes Repentance may and ought
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:106624:148"/>to be preſſed to and practiſed, when Baptiſm is unneceſſary, as in caſe of a Believers falling into ſin after Baptiſm: So on the other hand, Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm may be exhorted to and practiſed, when yet Repentance, or the profeſſion of Repentance, is no way neceſſary, as in the caſe of Chriſts Baptiſm; ſo in <hi>John Baptiſt</hi>'s caſe, ſuppoſing him, he being ſanctified in the womb, to have kept up the due exerciſe of Grace and Holineſs from his infancy: Now in theſe caſes theſe two duties are inſeparable in practiſe, and in ſuch caſes either of them may be diſtinctly and ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally preſſed to upon this ground: what is a ſufficient ground to bottom an Exhortation up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the practiſe of two duties, muſt needs, ſuppoſing theſe duties are inſeparable in their practiſe, be a ſufficient ground to bottom an Exhortation to either of them apart upon, ſo that though theſe two duties are conjoyned by the Apoſtle in his Exhortation, and both ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted to upon one and the ſame ground, yet they being ſeparable in practiſe, either of them may be exhorted to, and practiſed upon that ground, according to the caſe and condition of the parties concerned in them: whoever hath an intereſt in the Promiſe, in caſe of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of any ſin, may be exhorted to repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance upon that ſole ground of his intereſt in the Promiſe; ſo whoever hath an intereſt in the Promiſe, may and ought to be exhorted to Baptiſme, upon that ſole ground of his inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt in the Promiſe; an Exhortation to both, taken either conjunctively or ſeverally, may
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:106624:148"/>be rightfully grounded upon the perſons intereſt in the Promiſe.</p>
               <p>Hence ſecondly, I anſwer, Let it be granted, that the Apoſtle exhorts thoſe trembling Jews to repentance, as a neceſſary prerequiſite to their Baptiſm, yet that was only either in order to the confirming, continuing, and viſibly manifeſting their precedent intereſt in the Promiſe, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving that ſpecial bar, that lay in the way of their Baptiſm, 'twas their intereſt in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe that was the proper ground upon which the Apoſtle exhorts them to Baptiſm; Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance is no further neceſſary unto Baptiſm, then as it is a part of the condition of intereſt in the Promiſe, and an external diſcovery of that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt to the Adminiſtrators of Baptiſm, as in the caſe of perſons afore unconverted, or for the removing ſome ſpecial bar lying in the way of Baptiſm, as in caſe of Believers fallen into ſin afore the application of Baptiſm unto them; in caſe intereſt in the Promiſe may be known, when Repentance is not upon ſuch accounts incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent as a duty, that is, a ſufficient ground upon which to move unto and apply Baptiſm: And that which ſtrongly perſwades us to judge, that the Apoſtle exhorts to Repentance, not as ſimply and abſolutely neceſſary to Baptiſm, at all times and in all caſes, but only as neceſſary in their ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial caſe, and in caſes parallel with theirs, is not only his grounding his Exhortation to both theſe duties, upon one and the ſame ground, thereby plainly declaring their rightful practice, as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctively, when the caſe ſo requires, ſo ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately,
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:106624:149"/>or each a part by themſelves, when either of them is not neceſſary or practicable by the parties concerned in them upon that ſole ground; but the whole reference that Baptiſm hath to the Promiſe, or the Souls intereſt in it. Baptiſm hath no neceſſary reference unto Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance as already performed, ſo as its ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedency ſhould be indiſpenſably required, in order to a right application of it, neither hath repentance any neceſſary reference to Baptiſm, ſo as that Baptiſm may not be adminiſtred, but upon ſuppoſition of its antecedency, as we ſee in the caſe of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and <hi>John Baptiſt,</hi> as before noted, but Baptiſm hath a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect reference to the Promiſe, and the Souls in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in that; and therefore when repentance is required as a neceſſary prerequiſite to Baptiſm, it is only upon ſome of the accounts before mentioned; 'tis intereſt in the Promiſe that the Apoſtle grounds his Exhortation to Baptiſm upon, and conſequently intereſt in the Promiſe is a ſufficient ground for the application of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm.</p>
               <p>Now that the Infant-ſeed of believing Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents have a right to, and intereſt in that promiſe, hath been already proved, and reveives no little confirmation from this Text of the Apoſtle, <hi>The Promiſe is to you, and to your Children:</hi> but my deſign is not, <hi>Actum agere,</hi> to do that which others have done already: I ſhall therefore only ſay, that ſuppoſe it might admit of a doubt, whether Children here are to be taken, <hi>qua</hi> Children, as the Children of ſuch Parents as
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:106624:149"/>theſs the Apoſtle ſpeaks to, or whether their right to the Promiſe doth not ſuppoſe their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal ſalling: I ſay, though this might admit of a debate, taking this Scripture abſtractly in it ſelf, yet comparing this Scripture with the evidence before given, that the Promiſe runsin that extent and latitude, as to take in Parents and Children, ſurely it is paſt all rational doubt, that Children here are to be taken as the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of ſuch Parnts, <hi>the promiſe is to you and to your Children</hi> as they are your Children. But having ſo fully proved this, I ſhall add no more at preſent.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, To add ſtrength to the foregoing Arguments, let us take in thoſe ſeveral Inſtances recorded in the new Teſtament, of whole Houſholds being baptized upon the faith or converſion of one or both Parents: That, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the Parents, upon their faith, their reſpective Houſholds were frequently baptized, is in the new Teſtament fully declared: See <hi>Acts</hi> 16.14.15. ſo alſo verſe 33. of the ſame Chapter, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16.16. touching all which Inſtances let theſe three things be obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</p>
               <p>Firſt, That it is very probable, if not fully certain, that at leaſt ſome in or of ſome of theſe Houſes, ſaid to be baptized, were haptized not upon the account of their own perſonal profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Faith and Repentance, but upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of their Parents Faith. For the clearing up of this I ſhall premiſe three things.</p>
               <pb n="272" facs="tcp:106624:150"/>
               <p>Firſt, That under this term <hi>Houſe or Houſhold,</hi> we muſt comprehend and take in all the natural Children that were, at leaſt, then preſent, of theſe Parents, whoſe Houſes are recorded to be baptized, we muſt take the Holy Ghoſt, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the literal and proper ſenſe of his words, where there is no neceſſary Reaſon, as here there is not, otherwiſe to underſtand him.</p>
               <p>Secondly, That theſe Houſes or Houſholds may be rationally ſuppoſed to be conſiderably great; theſe phraſes, <hi>Houſholds, all his,</hi> and the like, note only a bare plurality of perſons, but that they were in ſome meaſure numer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, That not only Infants as new born, or in their infant-ſtate, but ſuch Children, who had arrived to a higher ſtate of childhood, or were grown to ſome years of maturity, muſt yet be rationally ſuppoſed to be baptized, not upon the account of their own perſonal profeſſion of Faith and Repentance, but upon the account of their Parents; and the Reaſon is evident, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſuch Children cannot be rationally ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to be capable of attaining to, in an ordinary way, a competent meaſure of knowledge in the Myſteries of the Goſpel in ſo ſhort a time, as did intervene between the Parents imbracement of the Goſpel and their own, and their Houſes Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm: And the Spirit of God, in his ordinary way of working, works according to the capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of the Subjects he works in and upon, <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>num quodque recipitue ſecundum modum reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pientis.</hi>
                  <pb n="273" facs="tcp:106624:150"/>Hence our Oppoſers muſt either ſay, that in their Houſes there were not only no Infants, but none in their childhood, or elſe they muſt ſay, that when the Holy Ghoſt ſpeaks of Houſes, he intended only ſome particular perſons in thoſe Houſes.</p>
               <p>But for the firſt, It is altogether im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probable, that there ſhould be ſo many Families, and yet no young Children in them, there is a probability there might be Infants, but much more that there were Children, who though paſt their infancy in a ſtrict ſenſe, yet improbably baptized upon the account of their own perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal profeſſion: and as for the latter, that would be to recede from the letter of the Text, which ought not to be without evident neceſſity, whereas here is none at all. And for the further clearing up of this firſt Obſervation, let us take a more particular account of that one Inſtance of <hi>Lydia</hi>'s houſe ſaid to be baptized with her; the ſtory you have <hi>Acts</hi> 16.14, 15. And here let three things be attended to.</p>
               <p>Firſt, That it is evident her Houſhold was with her at that Aſſembly of Women to whom the Apoſtle preached; for after her own and her Houſholds baptiſm, ſhe beſeecheth <hi>Paul</hi> to go home with her, verſe 15.</p>
               <p>Secondly, It is evident this was an Aſſembly of Women, verſe 13.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Here is no mention made of the converſion of any but of <hi>Lydia</hi> her ſelf. Now let things have their due conſideration; <hi>Lydia's</hi>
                  <pb n="274" facs="tcp:106624:151"/>Houſhold was baptized, that is, all her Houſhold, or all that appertained to her, that might be properly ſaid to be her Houſhold: it ſeems ſhe carried her whole Houſhold to that Aſſembly; this Houſhold probably numerous, or conſiſting of ſeveral perſons, otherwiſe the prrticulars would in reaſon have beeen menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned; here were no Males grown up, for it was an Aſſembly of Women: It is true, there might be Males in their infancy or childhood, it being no way unbeſeeming to carry ſuch to ſuch an Aſſembly, and notwithſtanding them, the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly might be ſaid to be an Aſſembly of Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men. Now how improbable is it, that there ſhould be a Family, a numerous Family, and not one Male among them; if there were any, they muſt rationally be ſuppoſed to be in their child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood; a great Family, and not one Infant or Child in it, but every one capable of a ready un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding what was taught, ſo as in a few hours to attain to a competent knowledge in the Myſteries of the Goſpel, and theſe all wrought upon by one Sermon, when none elſe in the whole Aſſembly, for ought is recorded, were wrought upon; yet that the Holy Ghoſt ſhould only take notice of the converſion of <hi>Lydia</hi> her her ſelf, and not in the leaſt intimate the converſion of any in or of her Houſhold, I will not ſay, but that it is ſimply poſſible, that there might be the concurrence of all theſe things, but it is to me altogether improba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that it ſhould be ſo, it is vaſtly more proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that ſome, if not all, that were baptized of
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:106624:151"/>her Houſhold, were indeed baptized upon the account of her Faith, and not upon the account of a perſonal profeſſion of Faith and Repentance that themſelves did mrke.</p>
               <p>But here it is ſaid, That this Houſhold of <hi>Lydia</hi> had ſome Men in it, as appears from verſe 40. and it is probable ſome Women alſo, who were converted with <hi>Lydia,</hi> and they are the Houſhold ſaid to be baptized.</p>
               <p>But to that <hi>I</hi> anſwer, That it doth no way appear that theſe Brethren, whom the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, verſe 40. is ſaid to have ſeen, were of <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia's</hi> Houſhold, they might be Neighbours con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted after <hi>Paul</hi>'s comming to her Houſe, who now came in to ſee <hi>Paul,</hi> or whom <hi>Paul</hi> before his departure went to viſit: 'Tis evident by what hath been already ſaid they were none of her Houſhold, ſaid before to be baptized with her; ſo that this one Inſtance, all things conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, makes it exceeding probable, if not evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently certain, that ſome in the Houſes, whoſe baptiſm is recorded in Scripture, were baptized upon the meer account of the Parents Faith, without conſideration had to their own perſonal Faith and repentance.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Let it be obſerved that it doth not appear, that any in or of theſe Houſholds were converted antecedent to their baptiſm, as for <hi>Lydia's</hi> Houſhold, there is not the leaſt intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the converſion of any beſides <hi>Lydia</hi> her ſelf; yea, there is, as we have already ſeen, <hi>tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum non,</hi> a certainty, that at leaſt ſome of her Houſhold were baptized upon the account of
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:106624:152"/>her faith, and not their own perſonal profeſſion; and as for the Gaolers Houſhold, it doth not cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly appear, that any in or of his, ſaid to be baptized, were converted antecedent to that their baptiſm: It is true, there are two paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges urged to prove, that they were ſuch of his as were wrought upon by the Word as ſpoken by <hi>Paul.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, It is ſaid verſe 32. <hi>That they,</hi> that is, <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas, ſpake to him the Word of the Lord, and to all that were in his houſe:</hi> Whence it is ſuppoſed, that all that were in his Houſe. and conſequently his, ſaid to he baptized, ver 33. muſt needs be ſuch as were capable of having the Word preached to them.</p>
               <p>But to that four things may be replyed.</p>
               <p>Firſt, It is uncertain whether this ſpeaking of the Word, of which <hi>Luke</hi> ſpeaks, was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedent to the baptiſm of the Gaoler and his Houſe; things are not alwayes declared in that order in which they were done.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Suppoſe that be granted, yet it cannot be concluded from thence, that there were none incapable of having the Word ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to them in his Houſe: See a like Inſtance <hi>Deut.</hi> 31. verſe laſt, it is ſaid, <hi>Moſes ſpake in the ears of all the Congregation of Iſrael the words of this Song, until they were ended:</hi> Now ſhall we conclude, there were no Infants or little Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren in that Congregation? The contrary is evident, verſe 12.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, It is no way evident, that the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in his Houſe, to whom the Word was ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:106624:152"/>were numerically the ſame perſons ſaid to be baptized, all of his ſaid to be baptized, ſeems plainly to intend different perſons from all thoſe in his Houſe, to whom the Word was ſpoken.</p>
               <p>But fourthly: Suppoſe the perſon were nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merically the ſame, yet the having the Word ſpoken to them, will not conclude their conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion by that Word, the Word may be ſpoken to thoſe that are not converted by it; ſo that this paſſage doth no way evince the converſion of any in his Houſe, beſides himſelf alone, antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to his and his Houſholds baptiſm: I do not ſay abſolutely there were none, but it cannot be certainly concluded that there were any.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The other paſſage urged to prove the converſion of the Houſhould antecedent to their baptiſm, is that verſe 34 where it is ſaid, according as we read, <hi>He rejoyced, believing in God with all his Houſhold;</hi> but the Greek runs exactly thus, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>He rejoyced with all his houſe, he believing in God.</hi> Now his houſe might rejoyce, though none were ſavingly wrought upon but the Gao<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler himſelf; and indeed the Apoſtles laying the ground of their joy in his perſonal believing, they rejoyced, he believing in God, doth plainly intimate, that as yet the Gaoler alopne did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, for why elſe ſhould he not ſay, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving in God, or at leaſt that the benefit, which was the matter and occaſion of their joy, did accrew unto them through his faith? 'Tis not
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:106624:153"/>for nothing that the Apoſtle makes his perſonal believing in God the ground of the joy of the whole Houſe; ſo that it doth not certainly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, that any in the Gaolers houſe did believe antecedent to their baptiſm.</p>
               <p>And for the Houſhold of <hi>Stephanus,</hi> there is nothing evidencing their or any of their faith antecedent to their baptiſm: 'Tis true, we read that his Houſhold did addict themſelves to the Miniſtry of the Saints, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16.15. But whether theſe, ſaid to addict themſelves to this Miniſtry, were converted before or after his imbracement of the Goſpel, and his and his Houſholds bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, is altogether uncertain.</p>
               <p>Thirdly obſerve, That ſuppoſe ſome parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular perſons in or of theſe Houſes, ſaid to be baptized, might be converted antecedent to their baptiſm, yet from thence it cannot be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, that in others Houſes it muſt needs be ſo alſo, not yet that the Houſholds, as generally conſidered, were not baptized upon the account of the Parents faith: as ſuppoſe there were any converted in the Gaolers Houſe antecedent to their baptiſm, from thence it cannot be conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that any in <hi>Lydia's</hi> Houſe were converted antecedent to their baptiſm; ſo ſuppoſe there ſhould be ſome of the Gaolers Houſe converted before their baptiſm, yet to argue from thence, that Baptiſm was not adminiſtred to the Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, as more generally taken, as the Houſes of believing Parents, is a meet <hi>non ſequitur:</hi> So that ſuppoſe it could be proved, which yet it cannot be, that ſome in or of ſome one or other
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:106624:153"/>of the Houſes, ſaid to be baptized, were bapt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed upon the account of their own perſonal profeſſion of Faith and Repentance, yet that would not overthrow the evidence that the Inſtances of any Houſholds being baptized, as a Houſhold of a Believer, gives in to the truth contended for; the probability of any one Houſhold, yea, or any one in or of any one Houſhold, being baptized, as the Houſhold, or as of the Houſhold of ſuch a Parent, carryes alike evidence to the truth pleaded for, as taken abſtractly in it ſelf, as it would do in caſe there were the ſame probability, that all theſe Houſholds, and all in them, were baptized, as ſuch Houſholds.</p>
               <p>From the whole of what hath been ſaid touching theſe ſeveral Inſtances, and that as taken abſtractly in themſelves, I ſhall not doubt to conclude, that there is at leaſt a very great probability, that in primitive times Houſes were, together with their converted Parents, bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, and that meeerly as the Houſes of ſuch Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents.</p>
               <p>And yet further, for the making it more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, that theſe Houſholds, ſaid to be baptized, at leaſt ſome in or of them, were indeed bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, not upon the account of a perſonal profeſſion of their own Faith and Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance but upon the account of their Parents Faith, as received into the ſame Covenant-ſtate with them, let theſe things be confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered.</p>
               <pb n="280" facs="tcp:106624:154"/>
               <p>Firſt, How exceeding improbable it is, that in caſe none could be admitted into communion with the Body of Chriſt by Baptiſm, but upon a perſonal profeſſion of Faith and Repentance, the Sacred Hiſtorian, writing by divine inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, would mention, and leave upon record, the baptiſm of any one Houſhold, without giving the leaſt intimation of the converſion of at leaſt one or more in or of that Houſhold, that ſo the ground of the baptiſm of the reſt might have been clearly inferred: That the Covenant, together with the Sign and Token of it, ſhould be of the ſame latitude and extent in the adminiſtration and application of it, that it was under the firſt Teſtament, might be ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally expected by all men: hence it may be well ſuppoſed, thta our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who is expreſly ſaid to be faithful in all his Houſe, as <hi>Moſes</hi> was in his, would if not have given ſome expreſs and poſitive diſcovery of his will, as to the baptiſm of perſons upon the perſonal pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of their faith and repentance, excluſive of all others, which our Oppoſers themſelves will hardly affirm that he hath done, yet would have given in ſo full and clear an account of the Apoſtles practice in execution of their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, <hi>To teach and baptize the Nations,</hi> as ſhould have evidently obviated all miſtakes, in a caſe wherein miſtakes ſo probably would be, when it is ſo evidently declared, that under the firſt Teſtament, upon perſons taking hold of the Covenant, both themſelves and Houſholds were admitted and incorporated into the Body of
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:106624:154"/>Chriſt, by the then Sign and Token of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant; and then declared in the New, that together with Parents, upon their imbracement of the Goſpel, their Houſholds were admitted and implanted into the ſame Body (as the Apoſtle is expreſs in <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 3.6. that the Body is one and the ſame) by Baptiſm, the preſent Sign or Token of the Covenant, and no account is given of the perſonal faith and repentance of any in or of thoſe Houſes, at leaſt ſome of them, as the ground of their baptiſm, beſides the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents alone: Sure none can deny, but here is a rational ground to ſuppoſe, at leaſt very probab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that the Covenant, and together therewith the Sign and Token of it, is of the ſame extent and latitude as it formerly was. Now I ſay, conſider how extreamly improbable it is, that the Holy Ghoſt ſhould record the Baptiſm of whole Houſholds, taking notice only of the faith and repentance of the Parents, without giving the leaſt intimation of the faith and repentance of any in or of ſuch Houſholds, thereby giving ſo clear a ground of miſtake, in caſe none under the new Teſtament adminiſtration ought to be admitted and incorporated into the myſtical Body of Chriſt, as viſible, but upon a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal profeſſion of their faith and repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Let it be conſidered, how the Holy Ghoſt doth vary his manner of expreſſion in his narrative of thoſe primitive tranſactions, when he ſpeaks of the baptiſm of Houſholds, he tells us, the Houſholds were baptized, together
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:106624:155"/>with their Parents, not giving the leaſt intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the faith of any in or of thoſe Houſes, as the ground of their baptiſm; but when he ſpeaks of more general Aſſemblies, or concourſes of people, he ſpeaks more diſtinguiſhingly, <hi>As many as gladly received the Word were baptized, Acts</hi> 2.41. And why the Holy Ghoſt ſhould ſpeak ſo diſtinguiſhingly in one place and not in the other, is hard to ſay, unleſs it ſhould be, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in reſpect of ſuch more general Aſſemblies and concourſes of people, conſiſting of grown perſons, the perſonal faith and converſion of each was neceſſary to their baptiſm, but not ſo in reſpect of the Houſes of believing Parents, but that is for theſe Inſtances, as taken abſtractly in themſelves: But now compare one thing with another, and the evidence is vaſtly more clear; for as conſidering what hath been ſaid, to prove the intereſt of the Infant-ſeed of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving Parents in the Covenant and Promiſes thereof, and what hath been ſaid, to evidence a right to Baptiſm to be of equal extent to inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt in the Covenant and Promiſes thereof, it is undeniable to me, and I can hardly, think, but it will be ſo to others, who will freely entertain Light when held forth unto them, that theſe Houſholds were baptized, as the Houſes of ſuch Parents, upon the account of their intereſt in the Covenant; ſo on the other hand, when we ſee what hath been before ſaid, concerning the intereſt of believing Parents in the Covenant, and concerning their right to Baptiſm upon that account, and then find whole Houſholds
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:106624:155"/>baptized, and that ſo very probably, to ſay no more, as the Houſes of ſuch Parents, it may much more ſtrongly perſwade us of that their intereſt in the Covenant and Promiſes there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and of their right to the Sign and Token of the Covenant. But let that ſuffice for the proof of our third ſubordinate Propoſition.</p>
               <p>What Objections the Truth we have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended for will meet with from the contrary minded, ſhall now be conſidered.</p>

               <p>NOtwithſtanding all that hath been ſaid for the confirmation of the three foregoing Propoſitions, yet ſome may ſay, That it is not the will of Chriſt, that the Infant-ſeed of believing Parents ſhould ordinarily be baptized (may be at leaſt very probably concluded) from thoſe various paſſages that do occur in the new Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament, wherein ſuch things are declared to have attended the adminiſtration of Baptiſm, and ſuch things are affirmed of, and required from the baptized in the primitive times, which cannot attend Baptiſm, as adminiſtred unto In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants, nor can be truly affirmed of, or rationally required from them. See 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.13, 21, 25. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.16. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.26, 27.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> This Objection will ſoon vaniſh, and appear to have no ſtrength at all in it, if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider theſe three things, which becauſe they are ſo obvious to every one of a competent underſtanding, and at all acquainted with the
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:106624:156"/>Scriptures, I ſhall need do little more than mention.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Conſider that what in theſe or the like Scriptures is declared of, or required from the Body of Chriſt, or the ſeveral Members of that Body, as united and incorporated, by the means (whether internal or external) appointed for that end and purpoſe, agrees to, and equally concerns the whole Body of Chriſt, and the ſeveral Members thereof, ſimply and abſolutely, in all times and ages; the Body of Chriſt is but one, ſucceſſively continued throughout all ages; and hence it may as well be concluded from theſe Scriptures, that Infants never were, nor ever ſhall be admitted into this Body, (the contrary whereunto is moſt evident) as that in the primitive times they were not by Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm admitted into it, as then exiſtent in the world.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Conſider that it is a thing of fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent occurrence in Scripture, for things to be declared and ſpoken of, or to whole Bodies or Societies, and that in the moſt univerſal and indefinite terms, which yet are to be underſtood and applyed variouſly, with reſpect to the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars, according to their reſpective capacities and concernments, in what is ſo declared or ſpoken: See this abundantly verified in that Speech of <hi>Moſes</hi> to the whole Congregation of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> recorded in the twenty nine and thirty Chapters of <hi>Deuteronomy,</hi> there are ſome things ſpoken as univerſally true of them all: So their ſtanding before the Lord, in order to their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newal
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:106624:157"/>of their Covenant with him, thus, <hi>Dout.</hi> 29.10, 11, 12, there are other things ſpoken, which were alone true of the grown perſons among them, and that but in part true of ſome of them, in whole true of others: Thus their ſeeing what God had done for them in <hi>Egypt,</hi> and in the Wilderneſs, ſome had ſeen both the temptations they had been tried with, and the Signs wrought before them in the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, but had ſeen nothing, in reſpect of a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal ſight, of what God had done for them in <hi>Egypt:</hi> Others had ſeen what God had done both in the Wilderneſs and in <hi>Egypt,</hi> and yet the ſame things are univerſally declared of them all, verſe 2. So again, there are other things afirmed and declared of them all in one and the ſame expreſſion, which yet were to be underſtood in a different manner, as applyed to particulars: Thus of their entring into Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, it is ſaid of them univerſally, <hi>They ſtood before the Lord to enter into Covenant,</hi> and yet they could not enter into it after one and the ſame manner, the grown perſons were to do it perſonally, the Infants and Children, incapable of a perſonal covenanting with God, were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred by their Parents. Yet take one more In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, that Command, to keep the words of that Covenant they were not entring into, is impoſed upon them all univerſally, verſe 9. <hi>Keep therefore the words of this Covenant, and do them, that ye may proſper in all that you do:</hi> Yet who will ſay, either that there were no Infants, or that Infants are capable to keep the
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:106624:157"/>words of that Covenant? So that we may ſee how variouſly, what is indefinitely, and in the moſt general and univerſal terms ſpoken to or of an Aſſembly, or united Body of people, as col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectively or generally taken, is yet to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood and applyed to the particulars of that Aſſembly, or Body of people. And ſeveral other Inſtances, of a like nature with this, might be given: See 1 <hi>Cor</hi> 10. begin. but I am wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to contract as much as may be: Thus in reſpect of the paſſages the Objection is ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon, what is declared to have attended the adminiſtration of Baptiſm, or what is ſpoken of or to the perſons baptized, is to be underſtood and applied to particulars, according to their reſpective capacities and concernments in what is ſo declared and ſpoken.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Let it be conſidered, to whom, or for whoſe uſe the Scriptures were written, as alſo what is the ſpecial deſign of the Holy Ghoſt in thoſe paſſages the Objection is grounded up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: And thus let it be conſidered, that the Scriptures were written to and for the uſe not of Infants, while in their infant capacity, but grown perſons; and the deſign of the Holy Ghoſt, in the places mentioned, is either to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct and eſtabliſh in ſome neceſſary truth, or preſs to ſome neceſſary duty; and hence what in the forementioned paſſages is ſpoken to or of the Body of Chriſt, and the ſeveral Members of that Body, only concerns ſuch perſons, and is of ſpecial uſe to the promotion of the deſign aim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at in them, but that is no Argument, that
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:106624:158"/>Infants, to whom theſe things agree not, and who are not concerned as ſuch in them, nor are capable of improving them to the end intended, were not of that Body, and conſequently not admitted into it by Baptiſm, eſpecially when the mind of Chriſt is fully revealed in other places as to that matter.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> 2 But the main and principal Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, and indeed which hath any conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble appearance of weight in it, is that raiſed from <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.19. compared with <hi>Mark</hi> 16.15, 16. where the inſtitution of Baptiſm, as is ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed by many, a Commiſſion authorizing and requiring the adminiſtration of it among the Gentiles, as is granted by all is recorded. Now ſay our Oppoſers, Infant baptiſm cannot be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the will of Chriſt, in as much as it agree not with the inſtitution of Baptiſm: the inſtitution warrants the teaching and baptizing the Nations, that is, ſay the Objectors, ſuch of the Nations as are taught, and by teaching made Diſciples, but here is not a word concerning the Baptiſm of Infants. Now ſay they, certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly had it been the will of Chriſt that Infants ſhould have been baptized, he would have ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed the inſtitution, as that his mind ſhould have been plainly and clearly held forth therein, touching this matter; but here not being the leaſt intimation that it is his will that they ſhould be baptized, therefore their Baptiſm cannot rationally be judged to be according to his will.</p>
               <pb n="289" facs="tcp:106624:158"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> I ſhall not debate the Queſtion, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this of <hi>Matthew</hi> be, or may be, fitly called the, or an inſtitution of Baptiſm, either abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, or unto us Gentiles, though let me ſay, it ſeems ſomething ſtrange to me, how it comes to bear the denomination of the inſtitution of Baptiſm, ſeeing Baptiſm was in uſe long before this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand was given out, and certainly the Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrators of it would not act without an inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, neither do I think it can properly be called the inſtitution of Baptiſm to us Gentiles. I doubt not, but this was only a Commiſſion given out by Chriſt to his Apoſtles, and in them to all the Miniſters of the Goſpel, authorizing and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jopyning them to adminiſter thoſe two Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, of preaching the Goſpel and Baptiſm, afore inſtituted, in ſuch an extenſive way, as is here expreſſed in the adminiſtration of which Ordinances the Adminiſtrators were and are to be regulated, not only by the letter of this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, but by all other directions Chriſt himſelf had, or yet ſhould give them, relating to that their adminiſtration: But let that paſs, call it the inſtitution of Baptiſm, abſolutely or reſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctively to us Gentiles, or a Commiſſion, it is much at one as to my preſent purpoſe: As for the Objection as afore laid down, a brief anſwer may ſuffice: Two things, I ſuppoſe, are and will be granted by the generallity of, if not uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally by all our Oppoſers.</p>
               <p>Firſt, That this Inſtitution or Commiſſion, call it which you will, doth not of it elf neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily exclude Infants from partaking of the Ordinance of Baptiſm.</p>
               <pb n="290" facs="tcp:106624:159"/>
               <p>Secondly, That this inſtitution or Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on doth warrant, yea, injoyn the application of Baptiſme to all thoſe our Lord Jeſus Chriſt hath in his Word declared, that it is his will they ſhould be baptized.</p>
               <p>Now let but theſe two things be granted, and I have what I deſire, having, as I judge, ſufficiently evidenced, that Baptiſm was practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in primitive times by the Apoſtles them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and by others, by their allowance, dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection and approbation, which whether I have done or no, I ſhall leve to the judgment of all judicious and impartial Readers, ſo that I might diſmiſs this Objection, the framers of it granting what I contend for: but yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I find this Objection ſo much inſiſted up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and accounted, by thoſe of the ableſt parts among our Oppoſers, to be the main and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Objection, to oppoſe that practice of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant-baptiſm we have hitherto pleaded for, I ſhall take it a little further into conſideration, and ſee what ſtrength it hath in it: and I find three things in a ſpecial manner urged, as giving ſtrength to it.</p>
               <p>Firſt, That that Relative <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>them,</hi> in this Commiſſion, muſt refer to Diſciples, included in the Verb <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, tranſlated by our Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors teach, by others, Diſciple, or make Diſciples, and not to <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, Nations.</p>
               <p>Secondly, That Infants being incapable of teaching, cannot be, nor in any propriety of ſpeech ſaid to be, Diſciples.</p>
               <pb n="291" facs="tcp:106624:159"/>
               <p>Thirdly, That this inſtitution or Commiſſion is to be underſtood excluſively, as excluding all from a rightful participation in that Ordinance of Baptiſm, who are not comprehended in it; and hence the ſum of what is urged from this inſtitution or Commiſſion, againſt the practice of Infant-baptiſm, amnounts to thus much, That the Subjects, appointed by Chriſt to be baptized, being Diſciples, and Infants not being, nor rightly to be called Diſciples, and all others beſides Diſciples being excluded from Baptiſm, by Chriſts appointing of them as the proper Subjects of that Ordinance; therefore Infants neither may nor ought to be baptized: And thus, I conceive, we ſee the utmoſt ſtrength of this Objection.</p>
               <p>For anſwer, I ſhall a little diſtinctly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider theſe three things giving ſtrength to it.</p>
               <p>And for the firſt, That <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, them, muſt refer not to <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, Nations, but to the Noun Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciples, included in the Verb <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, to teach as its Antecedent or Subſtantive.</p>
               <p>This I deny, and affirm on the contrary, that it ought to be referred to Nations, and not to Diſciples, ſuppoſed to be included in that Verb, and that for two Reaſons,</p>
               <p>Firſt, Becauſe we ought to keep to the lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and plain Grammatical conſtruction of a Text, where there is no neceſſary Reaſon to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force a receſſion from it: Now according to the literal and plain Grammatical conſtruction of theſe words, they muſt refer to Nations, wherther
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:106624:160"/>we tranſlate that Verb, teach or make Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, ſaith Chriſt, teach all Nations, or make all Nations Diſciples, baptizing them: Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing whom? Why, the Nations, who ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to this Commiſſion of Chriſt are to be taught, or made Diſciples: And hee is no ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary reaſon why we ſhould recede from the moſt literal and plain Grammatical conſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the words; what reaſon is pretended ſhall be taken notice of by and by.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Becauſe it is doubtful, whether the Noun Diſciples, ſuppoſed to be implyed in the Verb <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, were eyed by our Saviour in this Commiſſion; what is affirmed in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, is affirmed mainly, if not only upon the conceit of a Critticiſm, concerning the ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of that word, <hi>viz.</hi> That it muſt needs ſignifie, to teach <hi>cum effectu,</hi> or to teach till the perſons taught become Diſciples: But now whether this Critticiſm were attended to by Chriſt, or whether he uſeth the word in that ſene or no, is altogether uncertain: We ſee evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently <hi>Mark</hi> uſeth another word in ſetting down this Commiſſion, <hi>Go preach the Goſpel to every Creature,</hi> which, ſay our Oppoſers, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſevers this, <hi>Go teach all Nations;</hi> which if true, we may read the Commiſſion thus, Go preach the Goſpel to every Creature, or to all Nations, baptizing them; and then there can be no other antecedent, but the Creatures or Nations to be taught; and it is certain, the Goſpel may be preached where no ſaving effect is produced by it, in thoſe to whom it is preached; ſo that to
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:106624:160"/>leave the plain Grammatical and moſt literal conſtruction of the words, and to ground a conſtruction upon a ſuppoſed Critticiſm, whereas it is wholly uncertain, whether Chriſt eyed any ſuch Critticiſm or no, as uſing that word in this Commiſſion, is altogether unſafe, and therefore, I ſay, Nations, not diſciples, muſt be the antecedent to <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, them, injoyned by this Commiſſion to be baptized: But ſome Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons are urged to prove a neceſſity of taking Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciples, as included in that Verb, as the Antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to them.</p>
               <p>The firſt is this, Becauſe it is ſaid that Chriſt (<hi>viz.</hi> by his Diſciples) made Diſciple and bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized, <hi>John</hi> 4.1. therefore <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> muſt be in this place underſtood of making Diſciples alſo.</p>
               <p>But to that I anſwer, That though Chriſt and his Diſciples did by preaching make Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, yet all that they preached to were not made Diſciples; they preached the Goſpel to many who were not thereby made Diſciples: hence it will not follow, that becauſe Chriſt and his Diſciples made ſome, yea many Diſciples, by preaching, therefore the Apoſtles, and other Miniſters of the Goſpel, were injoyned by this Commiſſion to teach, <hi>cum effectu,</hi> in reſpect of all they were to teach: That they were and are to endeavour to teach ſo; as that the Word may be effectual, and Hearers may be made Diſciples, is unqueſtionable; but that they ſhould be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned ſo to preach, as that the uneffectualneſs of their Doctrine ſhould be their ſin, as it ſeems to be, in caſe Chriſt eyed that Critticiſm, can be
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:106624:161"/>no way inferred from this ſucceſs vouchſafed to their Miniſtry, whilke exerciſed among the Jews.</p>
               <p>But ſecondly, Though the Diſciples did bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe the Diſciples made by their preaching, yet it is not ſaid, they baptiſed only Diſciples; that Diſciples are to be baptized, ſuppoſe their caſe be the ſame with thoſe there mentioned, is unque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtionable; but that they only are to be baptized, is not in the leaſt intimated: So that from this expreſſion in <hi>John,</hi> it cannot with any ſhew of reaſon be concluded, that Chriſt had an eye to that aforementioned Critticiſm, in that word uſed by him in this Commiſſion; nor if he had, that yet Diſciples muſt needs be the Antecedent to them, the words may be as well read, Diſciple all Nations, or make all Nations Diſciples, bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing them, and yet Nations, not Diſciples, be the Antecedent to them.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Another Reaſon to enforce the ſence pleaded for by our Oppoſers, is this, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that ſence ſeems beſt to agree with the words of <hi>Mark, Mark</hi> 16.15, 16. where this Commiſſion is thus expreſt, <hi>Gopreach the Goſpel to every Ceature;</hi> which, ſay our Oppoſers, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers this phraſe, <hi>Go teach all Nations; he that believeth, and is baptized, ſhall be ſaved,</hi> which anſwers, ſay they, <hi>baptizing them:</hi> hence they infer, that the Subjects of Baptiſm are Diſciples, and theſe Diſciples muſt be Believers.</p>
               <p>But to that I anſwer, That there is no neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of our ſo interpreting the one Evangeliſt by the other; we may, conjoyning both together
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:106624:161"/>conceive the whole Commiſſion, as thus given out by Chriſt; <hi>Go ye therefore, teach all Nations, baptizing them;</hi> I ſay, <hi>Go preach the Goſpel to every Creature; He that believeth, and is Bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, ſhall be ſaved, he that believeth not ſhall be damned:</hi> And then as in theſe words recorded by <hi>Mark, Preach the Goſpel to every Creature,</hi> Chriſt explained himſelf, as to the extenſiveneſs of his meaning, in that phraſe, <hi>All Nations,</hi> uſed by <hi>Matthew:</hi> So in the latter clauſe, <hi>He that believeth, and is baptized, ſhall be ſaved; he that believeth not, ſhall be damned:</hi> Chriſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms them what the iſſue of their diſcharge of their Commiſſion ſhould be, in regard of the Nations to be taught, or Creatures, to whom the Goſpel ſhould be preached by them, thoſe that ſhould believe, and be baptized, ſhould be ſaved, but thoſe that believed not, however they might be baptized, yet they ſhould be damned; which muſt needs, according to the unanimous conſent of our Oppoſers, be underſtood of the adult; whence it will follow, that <hi>Mark</hi> ſpeaks not at all of the Subjects of Baptiſm, but of the iſſue of the Apoſtles diſcharging their whole Commiſſion, both in reſpect of preaching and baptizing, in reſpect of thoſe towards whom they ſhould diſcharge it, in caſe they ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Goſpel preached, or through the preaching of the Goſpel ſhould believe, and were baptized, then they ſhould be ſaved; but though they had the Goſpel never ſo faithfully preached to them, yea, though they might ſo far imbrace it, as to ſubmit to Baptiſm, yet unleſs
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:106624:162"/>they believe, they ſhould, notwithſtanding that, be damned.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, It is yet further urged, that in caſe <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, them, did refer unto <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, Nations with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any limitation, then this Commiſſion would warrant the baptiſm of any Perſon or Nation in the world, whether taught or no, which it is rightly ſaid, we our ſelves acknowledge ought not to be.</p>
               <p>To this the anſwer is at hand, 'Tis true, it would do ſo in caſe there were no other directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in any other part of the Scriptures, for the Miniſters of the Goſpel to regulate themſelves by in the diſcharge of this Commiſſion; but this ſuppoſed evil conſequence is ſufficiently obvia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in other places of Scripture, where the right Subjects of Baptiſm are ſufficiently declared, <hi>viz.</hi> grown perſons, in caſe they were not afore baptized upon their faith and repentance, and with them their Infant-ſeed; and this, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, is the very deſign of Chriſt in this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, to authorize, yea, enjoyn the preaching of the Goſpel, and adminiſtration of Baptiſm to the whole world, by perſons duly called to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſter Goſpel Ordinances unto men, yet ſo as to regulate themſelves, in reſpect of both the one and the other, by ſuch directions and limitations as himſelf had or ſhould give, in relation to a due adminiſtration of both Ordinances; and that the Diſciples and Miniſters of the Goſpel were and are to regulate themſelves in the diſpenſing the Goſpel unto men, as well in the adminiſtration of Baptiſm, by other Rules
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:106624:162"/>afore or after given by Chriſt, is ſufficiently evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent throughout the new Teſtament, ſo that notwithſtaning what it urged to the contrary. I conceive, it is fully evident, that <hi>them</hi> in this Commiſſion, ſpecifying the Subjects of Baptiſm, refers to Nations, not to Diſciples, as its Antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent.</p>
               <p>Now having diſcovered the uncertainty, yea, falſity of this firſt Principle aſſerted, and laid as a foundation to the Objection propoſed, the Objection is ſo far enervated, as that little need be added to the other two things, from which, in conjunction with this, it receives the whole of what ſtrength it hath.</p>
               <p>And therefore ſecondly, as to what is aſſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the ſecond place, <hi>viz.</hi> That Infants nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther are, nor can in propriety of ſpeech be called Diſciples, it concerns not me; it is enough, as to my preſent purpoſe, that they may be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended under that phraſe, <hi>All Nations;</hi> I ſhall therefore only ſay, that I cannot but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, that will men judge impartially, ſuppoſe we ſhould grant, that <hi>them</hi> in this Commiſſion of Chriſt doth refer to Diſciples, and not to Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and conſequently that Diſciples are the proper Subjects of Baptiſm; yet they muſt acknowledge, that what hath been ſaid by others to prove, that Infants may and ought, according to Scripture account, be numbred among the Diſciples of Chriſt, renders this Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection wholly inſufficient to counterballance the evidence produced from other Scriptures, for the eſtabliſhment of the practice now
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:106624:163"/>pleaded for, which is all at preſent I contend for.</p>
               <p>And therefore thirdly, As for that Aſſertion, That this Inſtitution or Commiſſion is to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood excluſively, and conſequently, that none are to be baptized, but ſuch whoſe baptiſm is in expreſs terms warranted by it. I ſhall on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſay it is true, we ought ſo to underſtand it, in caſe we had no other Scriptures for our directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the adminiſtration of Baptiſm, but take this Commiſſion or Inſtitution abſolutely in it ſelf, and the not including Infants in it, is not an excluding of them out of it. We ſee here Chriſt ſpeaks immediately and directly to his Diſciples, <hi>Go ye therefore, &amp;c.</hi> none beſides them are expreſly included in it, and ſhall we ſay therefore that this Gommiſſion only concerned them? Surely no, it is a Commiſſion for all that at that time, or in after Ages, ſhould be called forth by Chriſt to miniſter in the Goſpel; ſo it will not follow, ſuppoſe Diſciples be the Ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent to them, that therefore none elſe are to be baptized: As for what Inſtances are brought of Commands, expreſt only poſitively, &amp; yet inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted by all Interpreters excluſively, as 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.28. and the like, the Reaſon is, becauſe no other Scriptures allow any others, but ſuch there ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of, to partake of that Ordinance there ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of, otherwiſe the bare commanding perſons to examine themſelves, in order to their due re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving of that Ordinance, doth not of it ſelf exclude all others from it, that do not, or cannot examine themſelves; ſo that I ſay, the Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:106624:163"/>or Commiſſion, as abſtractedly taken, doth not exclude all from the participation of this Ordinance of Baptiſm, who are not in expreſs terms comprehended in it, which is all that I contend for, and as I have ſaid, I ſuppoſe will be granted on all hands; ſo that ſhould we grant, that <hi>them</hi> is to be referred to Diſciples, included in that Verb, and that Infants are not Scripture Diſciples, neither of which, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all that is ſaid by our Oppoſers, is granted, our Propoſition may ſtand firm, for though Infants are not expreſly included in the Commiſſion, yet they are not excluded out of it, therefore their Baptiſm muſt ſtand or fall by the evidence of other Scriptures, and we having ſufficient evidence from other Scriptures, that it is the will of Chriſt that they ſhould be bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized, their not being expreſly mentioned in the Commiſſion, ought to be no Remora in the way of our thankful imbracement of what light he hath elſewhere given of his mind and will in this matter.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> 3. There is an Objection or Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which ſome ſeem to conceive to have a very great ſtrength in it, yea, to be unanſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, which is carried on gradually to this iſſue, ſay the Framers of it, Seeing there is no expreſs Command requiring the Baptiſm of Infants, the practice muſt needs be deduced only in a conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quential way from the Scriptures: Now to prove that it cannot be rightly and duly deduced from any Scripture in a conſequential way, ſo as that
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:106624:164"/>the omiſſion of it ſhould be a ſin in the Parents, (and their ſin it muſt be if it be a ſin at all) againſt any Law of Chriſt, it is thus argued;</p>
               <p>If the omiſſion or neglect of the Baptiſm of Infants were a ſin chargeable upon their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, as being a tranſgreſſion of ſome Divine Law, then ſome one or other, at one time or other would in Scripture have been commended for the practice of it, or blamed for the neglect of it: But no one, at any time whatſoever, is in Scripture either commended for the practice of it, or blamed for the neglect of it; Therefore the omiſſion of it cannot be a ſin chargeable upon the Parents, as a breach of ſome divine Law.</p>
               <p>Which Argument laid down catagorically muſt run thus.</p>
               <p>Whatever practice is conſequentially deduced from Scripture, in caſe it be from Heaven, ſome one or other, at one time or other, hath been commended for the practice of it, or blamed for the neglect of it: But no one was ever com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended for the practice of Infant-baptiſm, nor blamed for the neglect of it; Therefore it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be from Heaven, but muſt needs be of men.</p>
               <p>And for the proof of the Major Propoſition, ſeveral Inſtances are produced of Duties conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quentially drawn, in reſpect of which we find, that ſome one or other, at ſome time or other, hath been commended for the practice of them, or blamed for the neglect of them: thus, if I miſtake not, that action of <hi>Phinehas,</hi> in ſlaying
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:106624:164"/>
                  <hi>Zimri</hi> and <hi>Cosbi,</hi> recorded <hi>Numb.</hi> 25.6, 7, 8. is produced as one Inſtance, and variety of other Inſtances are reckoned up.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> In anſwer to this Objection, or Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, I ſhall ſay in general, that were it not for the high conceit ſome have of it, and that the ſudden propoſal of it, eſpecially in the heat of diſputation, when the mind, variouſly diſtract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed cannot alwayes ſuddenly recal it ſelf to a due weighing of what is propoſed, may for a little while ſeem to puzzle ſuch, who yet upon a little ſerious review of it will ſoon diſcern the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream vanity of it, <hi>I</hi> ſhould wholly paſs it by, as not thinking it worthy an anſwer, the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of it ſo evidently appearing to all conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate perſons; but ſeeing it is ſuppoſed to be of ſuch ſtrength, for the oppoſing the practice I have hitherto pleaded for, I have judged it meet, to take it into conſideration, and as previous to a direct Anſwer to it, I ſhall premiſe theſe two Queſtions.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Whether it be neceſſary, for the deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining whether any controverted practice be from Heaven or of Men, that this commendati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or diſcommendation, of perſons practiſing or neglecting of it, ſhould be expreſly, or in plain words, declared in Scripture? or whether it be not ſufficient, that they themſelves may be conſequentially, and by way of Argument, drawn and deduced from Scripture.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Whether it be neceſſary that this commendation or diſcommendation, pleaded to
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:106624:165"/>be ſo neceſſary for the end mentioned, muſt be contained in ſome Scripture diſtinct from thoſe the practice controverted is deduced from, or whether it may not be ſufficient that they are contained in ſome Scriptures, which yet may be urged to give contenance to the practice under debate? And let the Framers of this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment anſwer to theſe Queſtions, as they conceive moſt conducing to the end deſigned in it.</p>
               <p>Theſe two Queſtions being premiſed, let us come more directly to the Anſwer; and it may be anſwered ſeveral wayes, according to the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer our Oppoſers ſhall give to the foregoing Queſtions.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Suppoſe it ſhall be ſaid, That it is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to determine any controverted practiſe to be from Heaven, in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> it can be conſequenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, or rationally deduced from any Scripture whatſoever, whether urged to give countenance to the practice controverted or no, That ſome one or other, at one time or another, hath been commended for the practice of it, or blamed for the neglect of it: Then I ſhall anſwer theſe two things.</p>
               <p>Firſt, I deny the Minor Propoſition, and ſay, that we have Inſtances of perſons commended for the practice of Infant-baptiſm, take theſe Inſtance, of <hi>Lydia,</hi> the Gaoler, and others.</p>
               <p>But it is replyed, It doth not appear that they had any Infants baptized, and therefore <hi>Luke</hi>'s telling us, that they and their Houſholds were baptized, cannot be interpreted as a commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:106624:165"/>to them for practiſing of Infant-bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme.</p>
               <p>But to that <hi>I</hi> anſwer, <hi>Lis ſub judice eſt,</hi> we judge they had, our Oppoſers judges they had not: And who ſhall be Judge in this caſe? Surely neither we nor our Oppoſers, being both parties in the caſe controverted. And therefore,</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>I</hi> ſay, That this Argument leaves the Controverſie as it found it, and is of no uſe at all for the end deſigned in it; Its deſign is to prove, that the practice of Infant-baptiſm is not from Heaven, but of men, and it leaves it as doubtful, whether it be from Heaven or of men, as it was before; for notwithſtanding ſuch com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendations or diſcommendations may be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced the way allowed in this Anſwer, yet the practice will be doubtful, and the Reaſon is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, becauſe it may be doubted, whether theſe commendations or diſcommendations are rightly and duly deduced from Scripture or no. And therefore,</p>
               <p>Secondly, I ſuppoſe the Objections or Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentators muſt needs ſay, That ſuch a commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation or diſcommendation, as is required, muſt be declared and expreſſed in ſome plain and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs Scripture, or the conſequence be drawn ſo evidently, as amounts to a plain and expreſs Scripture; but then how extreamly ridiculous the Arguments is, will ſoon appear to every ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary capacity; and the Major may be juſtly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied, and that for a fourfold Reaſon.</p>
               <pb n="304" facs="tcp:106624:166"/>
               <p>Firſt, It is evidently falſe, there are ſome practiſes conſequentially drawn, owned, and practiſed by our Oppoſers, as well as by our ſelves, reſpective unto which no one Inſtance can be produced of any, either commended for the practice of them, or diſcommended for the neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect of them: That Inſtance of Womens re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving the Lords Supper is obvious, that pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice is only warranted in a conſequential way; for where is any expreſs Command to warrant it? And let any ſuch Inſtance, as agrees with the ſence of the Oponent in the Major Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition be produced of any Women, that is in Scripture commended for the practice of it, or diſcommended for the neglect of it.</p>
               <p>Secondly, This Argument involves the Authors of it in an abſolute contradiction, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering what is and muſt rationally be granted by them, for the practice the Argument makes head againſt, muſt rationally be granted to be controvertible, or a practice that rational men may differ in their judgments about, ſome conceiving it is from Heaven, others conceiving it is from Men. Now let it be carefully obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that ſuppoſing there were any plain Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture expreſly declaring, that ſome one or other had been commended for the practice of it, or blamed for the neglect of it, how could it be controvertible among wiſe and rational men? Sure the producing of ſuch a Scripture would put it out of all queſtion among theſe that will be guided by Scripture light; ſo that this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument doth imply, either that a controverti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:106624:166"/>practice may be ſo evidently declared in Scripture, as to admit of no controverſie about it, or elſe that there is no ſuch thing as a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trovertible practice in <hi>rerum natura,</hi> which is an eaſie way of deciding all Controverſies; for as for duties plainly expreſt and declared in Scripture, no wiſe man will move a controverſie about them; and as for practiſes conſequentially drawn, the way is moſt obvious, to determine whether they are from Heaven or of men; if from Heaven, ſome one at one time or other would have been in Scripture either commended for the practice of them, or blamed for the neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect of them; if no ſuch commendation or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commendation be extant in Scripture, than they are infallibly of men: Now ſurely it may eaſily be found out, whether there be extant any ſuch commendation or diſcommendation, reſpective to any Religious practiſes whatſoever, ſo that were this Objection or Argument worthy of any notice to be taken of it, we ſhould ſoon have an end of all our Controverſies among all ſober Chriſtians. But</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Suppoſe no practice could be inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in beſides that in controverſie that is from Heaven, but hath received its atteſtation from God, one of the ways mentioned in this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and ſuppoſe the Framers of it were not involved by it, in ſuch a contradiction as afore declared, yet, I ſay, the proof is wholly inſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent. For</p>
               <p>Firſt, The Inſtances produced for the proof of it are wholly impertinent, as to the thing to
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:106624:167"/>be proved; for obſerve it, what is that which ought to be proved, in caſe the Argument make any oppoſition againſt the practice pleaded for? It is this, that all thoſe practices that are dedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced from Scripture only in a conſequential way, and on that account are controverted among rational men, ought to have a Teſtimonial from God, of their being from him, in caſe they are ſo, by his either ſomewhere in Scripture commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſome one or other for the practice of them, or blaming ſome one or other for the neglect of them; if this be not proved, the practice of Infant-baptiſm, though deduced only in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequential way, may be from Heaven, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding none have ever either been commended for the practice of it, or blamed for the neglect of it.</p>
               <p>Now mark, what do theſe Inſtances produced prove only this, that ſome practiſes may be lawful, which yet are deduced only conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially from Scripture, in as much as ſome have been commended for practiſing upon that ground, others have been blamed for the neglect of practiſing Duties ſo deduceable, <hi>Et quid hoc ad rhombum,</hi> what is that to the purpoſe? the Inſtances, if pertinent to the purpoſe for which they are brought, ſhould be of practices produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, as afore expreſt, which Antecedent to a lawful practiſe of them, have received ſome ſuch teſtimonial from God, of his approbation of them by the wayes mentioned.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Suppoſe we ſhould grant (which yet we by no means can do) that theſe Inſtances
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:106624:167"/>were pertinent, yet who can ſay the enumerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is full and compleat, yea, it is evident it is vaſtly deficient, for notwithſtanding we find ſuch and ſuch practiſes owned to be from God, by the commendation he hath given to ſome one or other for the practiſing of them, or by the blame he hath laid upon others for the neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect of them: Yet who can ſay, but that ſome duties and practices might have been duly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced in a conſequential way, from ſome diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very that God had afore made of his will, in reſpect of which there is no one Inſtance throughout the whole Scripture, of any one practiſing of them, nor mention made of any ones neglect of them? Shall we think, that no more duties were deducable from the ſeveral Laws, whether Moral or Ceremonial, or Judicial, then ſome have been commended for the practice of, or others have been blamed for the neglect of? It would be moſt irrational to ſuppoſe it. For any to infer, that becauſe ſuch and ſuch have been commended for the practice of ſuch duties, which they have conſequentially drawn from ſome antecedent diſcoveries of the will of God, or others have been blamed for the neglect of others that might have been conſequentially drawn, therefore whatever practice is duly inferred, by conſequence would have its at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation from God one of thoſe wayes, in caſe it were indeed from him, is as unreaſonable an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, as well can be drawn by any man that hath the uſe of his own Reaſon.</p>
               <pb n="308" facs="tcp:106624:168"/>
               <p>Fourthly, I anſwer, That the Inſtances men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned for the proof of the Major Propoſition, are ſo far from proving that, the confirmation of which is deſigned by them, that they do indeed prove the quite contrary: The thing to be proved is this, That all ſuch practiſes as are deduced conſequentially from Scripture, in caſe they be from Heaven, as the pleaders for them pretend them to be, would be declared ſo to be by ſome commendation recorded in Scripture, that God at one time or other had given to ſome one or other for practiſing of them, or by ſome reproof, that he at one time or other had given for the neglect of them.</p>
               <p>Now for the proof of this, ſeveral Inſtances are brought of practiſes deduceable only in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequential way, in regard of which, we read how God hath commended ſome for the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of them, and blamed others for the neglect of them.</p>
               <p>Now let theſe Inſtances be well weighed, and we ſhall ſee they prove the quite contrary to that, the confirmation whereof they are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned unto, namely, That a practice that is only conſequentially drawn from Scripture, may be lawful, yea, a duty, though none have ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedently been ever commended by God for the practice of it, or blamed for the neglect of it. Take that action of <hi>Phinehas</hi> in ſlaying <hi>Zimri</hi> and <hi>Cosbi,</hi> and ſuppoſe <hi>Phinehas</hi> to have deduced his duty in that particular only by way of conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, from ſome antecedent diſcovery of the will of God: Now it is evident, that <hi>Phinehas</hi>
                  <pb n="309" facs="tcp:106624:168"/>doth perform that duty, and was accepted of God in it, as only ſo conſequentially deduced, without any approbation of it from God, either of the wayes before mentioned, was there any one at any time, either commended for killing <hi>Zimri</hi> and <hi>Cosbi,</hi> or for killing any others upon the like occaſion, and yet we ſee <hi>Phinehas</hi> only deducing his duty in a conſequential way, is faithful in it, and is accepted and rewarded of God; and the like will be found true of all other Inſtances of the like nature, produced for the ſame end and purpoſe: And thus ſuppoſe the practice of Infant-baptiſm were only de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced in a conſequential way, and no one were ever commended for the practiſe of it, nor any ever blamed for the neglect of it, yet it may be ſafely practiſed, and none need, upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the want of ſuch Inſtances as is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, queſtion their acceptation with God; we have the Inſtance of <hi>Phinehas,</hi> and other of a like nature, for our warrant and incouragement, becauſe Saints have formerly been accepted, and highly rewarded for the doing of that their du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which they could only infer in a conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial way, and if we, following of them, do indeed rightly infer our duty, and faithfully practiſe it, we ſhall be alike accepted of God, and not miſs of our reward. From all that hath been ſaid, we may ſee the unreaſonableneſs of this Argument, and were it not for the Reaſons aforementioned, I ſhould have judged it rather worthy of contempt than a ſerious anſwer.</p>
               <pb n="310" facs="tcp:106624:169"/>
               <p>Theſe Objections being anſwered, I conceive, I may with ſafety and ſecurity to the Truth plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for, come to a cloſe only whereas it is by <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poedobaptiſts</hi> uſually q<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="3 letters">

                  </gap>ed, What can we ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally ſuppoſe can be the end of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, in appointing the application of Baptiſm to Infants while in their infancy? Or what good can accrew unto them by it, ſeeing it is certain they underſtand not what is done unto them, neither are they capable of making any preſent improvement of it?</p>
               <p>I judge it neceſſary to offer ſomething for their ſatisfaction, wherein yet I ſhall, on the account elſewhere mentioned, be very brief, and all that I ſhall ſay at preſent is this, That take Baptiſm, as the Sign, Token, or Seal of the Covenant, as it ought to be taken, and anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably applyed upon that ground, <hi>viz.</hi> their intereſt in the Convenant and Promiſes thereof, and as ſerving to, and performing thoſe various uſes and ends, with reference to which a Sign or Token in the general is annexed to the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant: And ſo I ſay, that as there were mighty ends of our Lord Jeſus, his appointing the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of it to the Infant-ſeed of believing Parents, ſo exceeding much good doth and, were it rightly and duly improved by them, as they grew up to a capacity inabling them there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, vaſtly more would accrew unto them thereby.</p>
               <p>I ſhall give this one Inſtance, and that is Its uſeful ſubſervency to their preſervation in that Covenant-ſtate, into which they, as the
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:106624:169"/>Seed of ſuch Parents, were afore admitted, and conſequently to the injoyment of all the good benefits and bleſſings of the Covenant, and the uſeful ſubſervency Baptiſm hath to this great end lyes in this, that thereby the Seed of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers are anticipated in their choice of what God they will ſerve, and what way they will walk in.</p>
               <p>For the clearing up of this let it be obſerved, that youth is ordinarily mans chuſing time, hence whereas we read in <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 12.1. <hi>Remember thy Creator in the dayes of thy youth. Arius Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanus</hi> in his <hi>Interlineal</hi> reads, <hi>In diebus electionum iuarum,</hi> in the dayes of thy chuſing; the word comes from a Root, which properly ſignifies, <hi>elegit, ſelegit,</hi> hence the Subſtantive, by a Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phor, is uſed to ſignifie a Youth or a young Man, either becauſe of the fitneſs of youth for ſervice, upon which account ſuch are uſually choſen out for ſpecial ſervice, whence is that frequent phraſe in Scripture, <hi>of choſen men,</hi> ſpeaking of Sould<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, or men appointed for war, or elſe becauſe youth is the ſpecial time of mans choice; Man ſo ſoon as capable of reflecting upon himſelf, and perceiving his own indigency, as to that happineſs his natural make and conſtitution yenders him capable of its forc'd to look out and caſt about him, for the gaining from without ſuch a ſupply as may compenſate that indigency he finds himſelf to lye under, and no ſooner doth man begin to look abroad into the world, but as variety of objects, ſo variety of wayes and courſes of life court to his mind and thoughts,
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:106624:170"/>from whence he may conceive a hope of furniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf with thoſe ſupplies; and as in the general, a Deity, with the wayes and means of his worſhip and ſervice, and the world, with the various wayes and means of gaining and injoying that, become Competitors in his choice: So ſeeing to all Nations, nor to all peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in each Nation, there is not one and the ſame God nor one and the ſame way of worſhipping &amp; ſerving him, &amp; ſeeing there are variety of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Objects in the world, &amp; various ways and means of gaining and injoying this or that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Object, hence he hath variety of choice, when in the general he is come to a reſolution with himſelf, whether it ſhall be by the worſhip and ſervice of a Deity, or by the gaining and injoying the world, he will attempt his own happineſs, and according as the mind is ſwayed towards, at leaſt ſo as to fix upon this or that object, or this or that way or courſe, ſuch uſually at leaſt frequently, is the man throughout his whole life and converſation, take it of the things of the world in general, as coming in competition with a Deity, with the way and means of his worſhip and ſervice, if the mind be ſwayed towards the world, ſo as to fix upon that, the man uſually lives an irreligious life, and proſecutes the world and the things of that throughout his whole life; but now if it pleaſe the Lord to open the eyes, and ſhew the Soul himſelf, and effectually draw and incline the mind to himſelf and his wayes with the benefit and advantages of chuſing, ſerving and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipping
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:106624:170"/>him, it is unto God and his wayes of worſhip and ſervice that the man applyes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, as the only way to attain unto happines. So take it of any particular object in the world, or any particular way or courſe of life, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as the mind fixes at the firſt, ſo is the man throughout his whole life and converſation. Now, <hi>I</hi> ſay, 'tis in youth at leaſt uſually, that the mind of man pitches upon this or that ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, this or that way or courſe, afterwards pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted, or after taken and walked in throughout the following part of his life; hence it is ſound, at leaſt very frequently, as for thoſe who injoy the means of Grace in their youth, if they are not then wrought upon to cloſe in with God in Chriſt his wayes and worſhip, as the only way to attain unto happineſs, they are ſeldom ever wrought upon.</p>
               <p>Now here is an eminent expreſſion of the goodneſs of God to his people, that as he hath extended his Covenant to their Seed, ſo he hath ordained the application of the Sign and Token of the Covenant unto their Seed as well as to themſelves, that he might thereby anticipate their choice, that when they come to look abroad into the world, they may find themſelves afore well provided for in their intereſt in God, and find themſelves preobliged to take God in Chriſt as their God and portion, and to walk in his wayes, they find themſelves not leſt at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to chuſe what God they pleaſe, or walk how or in what way themſelves pleaſe, but they find themſelves afore dedicated and given up to
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:106624:171"/>God in Chriſt, as his people, and obliged and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged by Baptiſm to cleave unto him, and to walk in his wayes, and ſuppoſing them by thoſe upon whom that concern is incumbent, inſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in this Obligation they are prevented by, and what is the danger of breaking of it, their baptiſm hath a moſt uſeful ſubſerviency to the preſervation of their Covenant-ſtate, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently their injoyment of all the good, bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings and benefits of the Covenant. And let me add thus much more, That Baptiſm having a bleſſing annexed to the adminiſtration of it, is one of thoſe means, ſuppoſing the party bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed come to make a due improvement of it, that God doth make uſe of effectually to incline the heart of the Seed of Believers, to a right and willing complyance with that Obligation put upon them by it; and by this little hint we may eaſily perceive, that God had weighty ends in injoyning the application of Baptiſm, the preſent Token of the Covenant, as well as Circumciſion of old, the then Token of the Covenant to the Infant ſeed of his People; and that the appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of it is of admirable uſe and benefit unto them, when duly improved by them; and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly then it muſt needs be not only highly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurious to the Seed of believing Parents, to withhold the Token of the Covenant from them, they being thereby deprived of a ſpecial means, ſubſervient to their preſervation, in their Covenant-ſtate and injoyment of all the good of the Covenant, but exceeding prejudicial to the intereſt of Chriſt in the world, the Tabernacle
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:106624:171"/>of <hi>David</hi> as we have before proved, is raiſed up, and upheld among the Gentiles, by Gods taking Families into Covenant with himſelf: Now to neglect a ſpecial means that God hath appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſubſervient to the preſervation of theſe Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies in their Covenant-ſtate, muſt needs direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly tend to the ruine and overthrow of the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt and Kingdom of Chriſt in the world: But not to inlarge upon this at preſent.</p>
               <p>From this little that hath been ſaid we may eaſily perceive, that the application of Baptiſm to the Infant ſeed of Believers, is no ſuch vain or uſeleſs thing, as it is by two many ſuppoſed.</p>
               <p>I have only a few more words to add, as a <hi>Coronis</hi> to the whole foregoing Diſcourſe, and I have done.</p>
               <p>That it is the will of our Lord Chriſt, that the Infant-ſeed of one or both believing Parents ſhould be baptized, is to me, upon the grounds afore laid down, unqueſtionable; how far it will be ſo to others I cannot ſay; only this <hi>I</hi> know, that whatever light is held forth by man, for the diſcovery of the mind and will of Chriſt, relating to any practice yet unleſs he, who is the great Prophet of his Church, ſhall vouchſafe to open the eyes of the mind, and prevail upon the heart to imbrace and ſubmit unto that light held forth, the holding of it forth will be whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inſignificant, as to any benefit accrewing therefrom unto men. Man may, according to what aſſiſtance is vouchſafed from Chriſt, hold forth light diſcovering the way he would have his People walk in, but 'tis wholly in his own
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:106624:172"/>power, whoſe Prerogative it is to lead into all Truth, to inlighten the mind, and cauſe that Soul to walk in that way: Leaving therefore the whole of what hath been ſaid in his hand, and to his bleſſing, I ſhall wind up all with a three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold advice, according to the various, ſentiments of men about, and their various concerments in the practice <hi>I</hi> have contended for.</p>
               <p>Firſt, As for ſuch who have been, and not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding what is here offered, or hath been by others, ſhall ſtill remain to be ſo far diſſatisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed about the practice we plead for, as wholly to omit it, and walk in that way that lyes in a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect oppoſition thereunto, let me adviſe, and in the Spirit of meekneſs earneſtly beſeech them to carry it, under their preſent perſwaſions, and practiſe with a holy fear and trembling. The grounds held forth in the foregoing Treatiſe, and by ſeveral others, pleading for the ſame Truth, ſeem ſo full and clear, yea, to me ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing,, that <hi>I</hi> can hardly fear being accounted over confident; though <hi>I</hi> take it for grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that the moſt confident and reſolved of our Oppoſers muſt needs acknowledge, that our doctrine and practice of Infant baptiſm ſtands upon the ſame level of probability, if the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage be not on our ſide, that the oppoſite Doctrine and practiſe doth, and that upon ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of our Doctrine and practice being found agreeable to the mind and will of Chriſt, the oppoſite Doctrine and practice muſt needs be highly prejudicial to the comfort of believing Parents, the good of their Seed, and which is
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:106624:172"/>moſt of all, eo the ſupportation and propagation of the intereſt and Kingdom of Chriſt in the world. And let me add, that when the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences of refuſing or claiming a priviledge are of an even ſize, the refuſing ſuch a priviledge, ſuppoſe it be indeed granted, and ought to be accepted of, is a greater ſin, and more diſpleaſing unto God, than the claiming and appropriating of it, ſuppoſing it be not granted, nor that claim really warranted by Scripture is, as is evident to every conſiderate perſon: we ſee how much God was offended at <hi>Ahaz</hi> his refuſing a Sign when offered to him; how much God was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed with <hi>Moſes</hi> for neglecting to circumciſe his Child: therefore, I ſay, walk with a holy fear and trembling, leſt as ſome will meet with a <hi>Who required this at your hand?</hi> ſo you ſhall meet with a <hi>How durſt thou refuſe this priviledge at my hand?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, As for ſuch whoſe judgment and practice agree with, and anſwerably are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by the foregoing Diſcourſe, eſpecially ſuch to whom God hath vouchſafed that bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of Children, let me adviſe, and importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately intreat them, yea, in the Name of our Lord Chriſt command them, that they ſatisfie not themſelves in the bare diſcharge of their duty, in regard of the application of Baptiſm to their Seed in their infancy; know that your work is not done when you have brought yours within the verge or under the bond of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant; you will find in the foregoing Papers, that your Seeds inheriting the good which, in
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:106624:173"/>common with you, they are Heirs unto, depends much upon your faithful and wife diſcharge of your duty towards them, as growing up to years of maturity: <hi>Abraham</hi> muſt command his Houſhold that they keep the way of the Lord, and that to this end, that God might bring upon him the good promiſed, with reference to his, There is hardly any thing a greater diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to Miniſters, in pleading for an admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtring Infant-baptiſm, than the great neglect of Parents towards their Children, when baptized and grown up to a capacity of underſtanding and improving their Baptiſm, afore adminiſtred to them; therefore ſeeing you lay claim to <hi>Abraham</hi>'s bleſſing, as his Children, walk in <hi>Abraham</hi>'s ſteps, both in reſpect of your own perſonal faith and holineſs, and alſo in inſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and commanding your Children, that they may keep the way of the Lord: In particular, let them know their priviledge, and the danger of forfeiting of it, by breaking that Obligation put upon them by Baptiſm.</p>
               <p>thirdly and laſtly, As for ſuch who are the Seed of believing Parents, and who by Baptiſm have been dedicated and given up unto God in Chriſt, and incorporated into his my ſtical Body, as viſible: Let me adviſe, perſwade and charge them, that they lay no more weight upon their Baptiſm, in relation to their eternal happineſs, than the nature of the Ordinance, and the end of Chriſt in appointing the application of it, will warrant. Baptiſm, abſtractly taken, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly ſecures Salvation to none; neither can
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:106624:173"/>Baptiſm of it ſelf be laid as a ſure ground to bottom a plea for Salvation upon; <hi>He that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liveth, and is baptized, ſhall be ſaved; but he that believeth not,</hi> however baptized, <hi>ſhall be damned,</hi> is one of thoſe unalterable Decrees laid up in the Records of Heaven: In reſpect of which we may ſay, as <hi>Job</hi> in another caſe of God, <hi>He is of one mind, and who ſhall,</hi> that is, none ſhall, <hi>turn him,</hi> Job 23.13. Your abiding in and injoyning the benefits of the Covenant, into which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> as the Seed of ſuch Parents, you were admitted in you infancy, undiſpenſably requires your perſonal faith and obedience; therefore be faithful in the diſcharge of your duty, and in ſo doing you may, upon ſure grounds, apply and improve your Baptiſm, as Gods Seal, infallibly ſecuring your injoyment of the good promiſed.</p>
